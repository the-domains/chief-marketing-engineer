 last week Google broke the news that Glass is moving out of Google[x] 
and into a standalone company within Google.  Of course the first thing I
 heard from the jolly masses was, “did you hear glass is dead?”  Of 
course reading the </p><p>
 tells quite a different story, and glass is not dead at all.  But this 
got me thinking about the future, how fast its coming, and how some try 
to resist it.</p><p>This is a post about the future.  It’s not a prediction or 
prognostication — it’s an observation stemming from quietly and intently
 observing those that are our future — our children.</p><p>My kids have had an iPad or iPod touch since before they turned two. 
 As if by divine intervention they learned to navigate to Netflix and 
find their favorite shows before they could find the potty or string 
words into a sentence.  They’re a bit older now, so they’ve spent years 
already growing up with this technology, and by the time they are 
college age will have spent well over a decade.</p><p>Last summer we went to my parents house.  They still overpay for 
extended cable options, which is ironic because the model has them pay 
extra to watch commercials — but that’s for another post.  Anyway, my 
kids don’t know what a commercial is.  Think about that for a second.  
Imagine the breakdown a four year old can have when “someone turns off 
his show”, because a commercial comes on and they’ve never seen one.  
Now extrapolate that out to the confusion when you try to convince him 
his show “doesn’t come on until 2pm”.  In the world of always on 
streaming media, there is no concept of “not on right now”.</p><p>Grandpa still watches TV shows and commercials on <em>their</em> schedule.</p><p>The broadcast model is dead, they just don’t know it yet.  They’re 
one generation away from people who won’t put up with $200 per. month 
cable packages, 800 channels of nothing to watch, and series that are 
released weekly and take the summer off to play re-runs.  So if this is 
your model, you’ve got about ten to fifteen years to update it.</p><p>The next major change I see devices — digital natives are growing up 
with them.  Just the other day my son touched the screen of my MacBook 
Pro with a zoom gesture as if it were a tablet.  Think about that.  One 
of the most expensive and current laptops on the market and to a young 
child it’s already antiquated.  We find cameras intrusive and voice 
commands difficult, but it’s because we’ve still got our training wheels
 on while they simply think that way.  Apple has Siri, Google has Google
 voice, Microsoft has Cortana — even touch screens are becoming 
antiquated.  If this is your hardware, you’ve got about ten to fifteen 
years to update it.</p><p>Grandpa still uses a keyboard and mouse.</p><p>Then there’s the music industry.  Per <a href="http://www.midiaresearch.com/blog/view/how-streaming-is-changing-the-music-industry-.html" title="HOW STREAMING IS CHANGING THE MUSIC INDUSTRY">MediaResearch.com</a>,
 although streaming subscriptions are slated to grow by 238% 2013-2019, 
downloads are declining by 39% and CDs are falling even faster at 44%, 
leaving streaming to make up 70% of all digital revenue in the music 
industry.  I’m sure Taylor Swift considered this when she pulled her 
album from Spotify.  In my house we almost exclusively use Pandora, 
Amazon Prime, and Spotify on our devices to stream in our house and in 
our cars, which means my kids are growing up without the concept of 
album sales, radio static, or top 40.  If this is your model, you’ve 
probably got a lot less than ten to fifteen years to update it.</p><p>Grandpa still listens to the radio — it’s so staticy and <em>they</em> play what <em>they</em> want you to hear.</p><p>Amazon revolutionized (and revitalized) the book industry and 
promptly destroyed it again with Kindle.  Netflix did the same thing 
with videos, subsequently destroying it with streaming.  The lists and 
examples go on and touch nearly every industry.  Even those things we 
view as current, like smartphones, are becoming antiquated by wearables 
because you still have to take it out of your pocket.  Imagine instead a
 device with no screen that relies on your watch, your glasses, your 
earpiece, your car, or your home to communicate.</p><p>I find it interesting when people tell me things like they, “just 
have to disconnect,” or like to, “keep work and personal separate.”  The
 next generation never disconnects.  In fact, their connections are 
getting faster and easier and they’re getting better at them.  They’re 
more digital than digital natives — they’re born digital, and they’re 
always connected — and they have a perspective we need to learn if our 
brands are to survive.</p><p>This brings me back to the start of this post: Google Glass and the 
start of my exploration of it.  I remember it clearly.  I was sitting at
 a table discussing the Olympics and someone asked how the US was doing.
 “Okay glass,” I said, “Google how many gold medals does the US have in 
the Olympics?”  And before anyone could lug one of those heavy 
“smartphone” devices out from deep within their pocket or purse I 
already had the answer.</p><p>There are those who hate it, and to each his/her own, you can do 
that.  But what you can’t do is deny it.  Because today we are on beta 
version 1 of the device.  It’s “bulky” and obvious when I wear it when I
 walk into a room.  But it won’t always be.  15 years from now we will 
be on version 17.  There will be competition from Microsoft, Facebook, 
Samsung, Google, and Apple in the marketplace.  It will be better, 
faster, and “less creepy.”</p><p>But that won’t matter. Because the next generation will have grown up
 with it.  They understand the value of it.  They rely on the utility of
 it.  When they go do a doctor they won’t be concerned about privacy if 
the Doctor is wearing it, they’ll be more concerned about the quality of
 care they are getting if the Doctor is not.  Unless you’re doctor 
House, not being connected is an antiquated model.  Not just for what we
 currently think of “going to the doctor”, but for the future of mHealth
 as well.</p><p>Which brings us to today, where headlines that read “Google Glass is 
Dead” could not be further from the truth or the reality.  The reality 
is Google is graduating Glass from Google[x] to Google proper where it 
can be mainstreamed out of beta.  Just days later Microsoft released 
HoloLens — a virtual reality headset that takes glass to the next level,
 further ushering in the era of holographic computing.  Samsung has Gear
 VR, and Facebook owns Oculus with Zuckerberg noting it as the future of
 social.</p><p>These are the new models.  So next year, when it’s time to check the Olympic medal standings, you’ll know that only </p><p>grandpa</p><p> still has to actually take his phone out of his pocket.  If this isn’t your model, you need to update it.</p><p> - See more at: <a href="http://www.matthewbalogh.com/?p=3477#sthash.cG0mSFvy.dpuf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">matthewbalogh.com/?p=3477#sthash.cG0mSFvy.dpuf</a></p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="14"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="15"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="16"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="17"><span data-reactid="18"><!-- react-empty: 19 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="20"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="21">Grandpa Still Takes His Phone Out Of His Pocket</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="24"></div></div></div></section></div></div>

subscriptions are slated to grow by 238% 2013-2019, \ndownloads are declining by 39% and CDs are falling even faster at 44%, \nleaving streaming to make up 70% of all digital revenue in the music \nindustry.  I’m sure Taylor Swift considered this when she pulled her \nalbum from Spotify.  In my house we almost exclusively use Pandora, \nAmazon Prime, and Spotify on our devices to stream in our house and in \nour cars, which means my kids are growing up without the concept of \nalbum sales, radio static, or top 40.  If this is your model, you’ve \nprobably got a lot less than ten to fifteen years to update it.</p>","metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"starred":false,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"_description":"","keywords":[]}},{"id":"2912f955-0788-4e91-88c6-24c490e9b557","item":"74c8d7ad-f8fb-4952-9aa6-098b550d7755","type":"text","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_text":"Grandpa
