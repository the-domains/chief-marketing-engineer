# When Value Added Does Not Add Value

The concept starts as an organization who wishes to increase value to their customers. Not so bad. But what happens when this goes horribly wrong? Suddenly it becomes blatantly obvious that you really don't know your customers very well. And that's a scary thing.  
**1\. Do not inconvenience your customers to add value**.  
A friend of mine, like a lot of people these days, is looking for a job. She's been working on her resume for some time, has consulted a professional career counselor and utilized the resume critiquing services of a prestigious pay-to-play job placement website. While in her job search she found an opportunity on a job board which caters to the alumni of her alma mater and wished to apply.

Her resume was denied. It had taken over a week for them to get back to her, a week she had spent not applying to a potential job opportunity, and now she was denied. She had worked hard, payed good money for professionals, and her resume was denied. As it turned out, the university has it's own set of career counselors who, as a service to her, review and critique resumes. But, rather than offer this as a value added service, they impeded her job search and frustrated her. Where's the value in that?  
**2\. Understand the value your customers are seeking before adding to it**.  
There are lots of ways organizations can add value, but without understanding customers it's really just a shot in the dark. This is where customer relationship cultivation and behavior first marketing comes into play. Cultivating relationships with your customers helps you understand what is important to them and the real value your organization is providing.
