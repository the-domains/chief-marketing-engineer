# New Media: Market Development or Penetration?

In his latest blog post,[Whether or which][0], Seth Godin makes an excellent reference to the strength of new media in expanding market share vs. expanding the market in general. I'd like to take his concept a step further by contending a hidden market exists which, when tapped, acts like market expansion with all the benefits of market penetration. And new media is the perfect way to gain access to it.  
Within the Marketing 1.0 paradigm market penetration concentrates on bringing new customers into your existing market and market development looks to convince existing members of the market to use your product. But what if I told you there was a gray area of your market lurking in the shadows? One that's made up of_individuals_who exist in your market and would use your product, but your Marketing 1.0 tactics have not reached. There is. Do not misread! This is not about "reaching the unreachable". It is about leveraging the strengths of new media to reach those_individuals_currently in your market beyond the reach of Marketing 1.0, but perfectly poised to be touched by Marketing 2.0\.  
I'm talking about the new "preferred method of contact". Don't send me an email and expect me to read it, even if it does have my name personalized at the top. I get many of these every day, and I read none of them. Do @ message me on twitter. If you're message is relevant and interesting, I'll RT to all my friends and you'll get more than you bargained for. Create interesting and relevant information consistently and I'll follow you at your twitter account. Want me to opt-in to your newsletter? Instead, how about a Facebook profile I can become a fan of? [Skittles][1]did a great job with their profile and now I see updates right next to the status of my best friends and family, along with nearly 900,000 other people. That's 900,000_individuals_who said, "yes Skittles, you may market to me". That's a Marketing 1.0 value of 30,000,000 given the traditional 97% failure rate of mass emails!  
What's left? Plenty. How about a blog? Have something relevant and timely to say and customers will listen... but only if you listen too. Make sure comments are enabled!
