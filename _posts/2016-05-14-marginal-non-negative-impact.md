# Marginal Non-Negative Impact

You send emails every day. You send an email to a friend or colleague, and it goes through. Occasionally you check the spam folder to see if anything important was missed. Usually it wasn't. Spam filters have gotten pretty good in that way. But, in this case, the spam filter is on your side. As marketers, even legitimate ones, this is not the case. Many people do not realize the real impact of spam filtering on legit marketing campaigns. Here are just a few things that happen:  
Email has fallen into a "more the merrier" routine. The variable cost of adding individuals to lists is nearly zero, so the party grows. If they don't want to get the email, they'll opt-out, right.

ISPs maintain "white lists", much like the permanent record your teachers always threatened you with, of email senders. It contains both a history and a rating.

Lower your rating and lower your deliverability, the rate at which you are allowed to send emails, and a few other important factors which catapult you into the downward spiral of being denied by the ISP.
