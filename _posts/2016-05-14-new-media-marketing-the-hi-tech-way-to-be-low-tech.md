# New Media Marketing: The Hi-Tech Way to be Low-Tech

The whole idea behind new media and social networking is to form deeper relationships with customers which can be cultivated into a strong bond and, hopefully, brand loyalty.

We spend millions to form and cultivate the relationships but, in the process, do we forget about the relationship itself?
