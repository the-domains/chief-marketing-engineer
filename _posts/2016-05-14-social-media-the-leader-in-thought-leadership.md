# Social Media: The Leader in Thought Leadership

The best and brightest minds in your industry don't work for you. Well, some might, maybe one, but the vast majority do not. This leaves you two options: one, attempt to identify, locate, and hire them -- a time-consuming and expensive proposition, assuming they are for hire -- or two, work with them to incubate and develop ideas within your industry for free.  
Some companies,[Ideo][0]for example, based their business model on employing the best and brightest minds.

She's an enthusiast, not a professional. Does this make her contribution any less great? Of course not.
