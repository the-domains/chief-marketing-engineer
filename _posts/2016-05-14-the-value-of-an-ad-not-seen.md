# The Value Of An Ad Not Seen

What is the value of an ad not seen?Â Worse yet, what is the value of an ad seen but not acted upon?Â For years we as marketers have worked hard to turn the Internet into a place where ads are proactively blocked, filtered, and ignored.Â Agencies are paid to increase list size, not list quality.Â Rather than put time into properly segmenting our prospects and compiling an offering that is relevant, we collect information in any way possible and blast emails to everyone.Â This is because we choose quantity over quality thinking we're getting the best bang for our buck.Â We're not.  
**The economics of increasing list size.**  
Agencies are paid to increase the size of lists, increase club memberships, and collect prospect information in any way possible.Â They do this in all sorts of "creative" ways from refusing to filter out known dead leads (can't decrease the list size) to collecting information on prospects that have no interest in the productÂ Just the other day I was at the[NJ State Fair][0]and I was approached to sign up to win a smart car.Â All I had to do to enter was give them all my contact information.Â But what did they think they were going to do with this information once they had it?Â Beyond showing the increasing aggregate list counts to clients, I don't think they cared.Â The scary part is some client out there might actually think the contest was a success.

**Customer Relationship Cultivation (CRC):**  
That was yesterday.Â Today's new media rich environment is very different.Â Sure there are those who still use mass advertising to prey on individuals, but that's not new media marketing (despite the actual media used).Â Today we've collected a lot more information on our customers and we're learning how to use it right.Â We're learning to create value for them, not for us at their expense.Â We still talk about CPM, but we don't live by it.Â Even click-through rates (CPC -- cost per click) are becoming an antiquated statistic.Â Today's marketing is about behavior.Â It's about action.Â We understand that customers act first and purchase based on behavior, not the other way around.Â And we use new media to leverage this idea.Â Let me explain with two great examples from Zain Raj's[Behavior First][1]blog:

1. Say you are a property and casualty insurer. And, say you want to increase your footprint in the home insurance market. Based on your data you can identify customers that have not had any claims, they take care of their homes and are likely to stay there for a while. Because of this they are very profitable customers but possibly vulnerable. What if you mailed them a check to invest in their homes? Would this make them more loyal? Would this be compelling for others? When was the last time an insurance company sent you a check?  
2. Say you are a wireless phone company. You have data on your customer usage of the various services. Based on this data you will see a group of customers who donâ€(tm)t use what they pay for. They buy 1,000 minutes but only use 600\. What if you sent a note telling the customer that based on their usage, you are either willing to reduce their monthly charge or they can apply the difference to other services. Experience shows that most of the customers will apply it to other services and their loyalty and spend with you will increase.

CRC can make this happen.Â  It's the perfect storm of marketing.Â  Think about it.Â  First, a customer you retain is much less expensive and much more profitable than a customer you acquire.Â  Second, you already have data on your most profitable customers.Â  Third, great experiences stand out in the mind of customers.Â  A great customer experience in itself is marketing -- recommendation marketing.Â  And a good recommendation goes a long way.
