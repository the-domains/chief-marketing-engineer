# Book Review: Good to Great

**Jim Collins. (2001)._Good to Great_. HarperBusiness**  
Jim Collins and his team did a great job of breaking down both business and leaders into factors that helped make them successful.Â Though Collins markets it as a business book I believe, like those of Covey, the theories in this book will serve you well in both business and personal aspects of your life.Â This book was used as a text in my MBA studies at Fairleigh Dickinson Universityâ€(tm)s Silberman College of Buisness, a nationally top ranking entrepreneurship school.Â As such Iâ€(tm)ve engaged in many hours of discussion with both students and seasoned professionals about the merits and short-comings of this book.  
First, Iâ€(tm)ll start with where it comes up short since everyone loves that and Iâ€(tm)d prefer to finish on a positive note anyway.Â Some people feel that Collinsâ€(tm)s findings just arenâ€(tm)t possible to implement in real world work environments.Â Others argue that most of this material just doesnâ€(tm)t apply to anyone thatâ€(tm)s not a senior executive in the organization.Â Last, and my favorite, is the rational that success, especially in these companies, is random and luck based.Â I contend theyâ€(tm)re all wrong, and Iâ€(tm)ll tell you why.Â The only criticism of this book I do accept is Collinsâ€(tm)s criteria for a successful company is purely financial, which I donâ€(tm)t agree with, but he does address his reasoning right at the beginning.Â I understand why he had to do it, but I still donâ€(tm)t agree with it.  
To those who argue Collinsâ€(tm) methods are not implementable in the real world I say quit arguing the metaphors and learn from the principles.Â Try not to get stuck duplicating the examples Collins uses in the book, they are just examples.Â Read between the lines and just pull out what heâ€(tm)s trying to sayâ€¦ â€œfirst whoâ€¦â€, â€œThe Hedgehog Conceptâ€, â€œThe Flywheelâ€, and, if you have the audiobook, pay close attention to the student question in the epilogue.Â These are simple concepts that can have a great impact on you, your organization, and your career.Â I contend that each and every one of the theories in this book can be implemented in business at all levels, not just at the top, as well as everyday life.Â I believe you can be a level five leader in life, not just in business.Â The book_Leadership and Self-Deception_, by The Arbinger Institute, is a great book to emphasize this point.  
And, finally, for anyone that feels success is random and/or we canâ€(tm)t break it down into a set of rules or principles Iâ€(tm)d recommend reading Talebâ€(tm)s_The Black Swan_, (a great book btw) which might make you feel better about yourself.Â Iâ€(tm)d also recommend_Outliers_by Gladwell, another book which does in-depth research into success.Â Look specifically at the 10,000 hour rule and see how well it fits with Collinsâ€(tm)s Flywheel concept.
