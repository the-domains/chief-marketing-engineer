# Book Review: Leadership and Self Deception

**The Arbinger Institute. (2000)._Leadership and Self-Deception: Getting Out of the Box_. San Francisco: Berrett-Hoehler.**  
The Arbinger Institute did a great job of explaining their theory as will serve you well in both business and personal aspects of your life.Â It was a very easy read and has a lot of potential to make you think about yourself and how you relate to both the world and your job.Â This book was used as a text in my MBA studies at Fairleigh Dickinson Universityâ€(tm)s Silberman College of Buisness, a nationally top ranking entrepreneurship school.Â As such Iâ€(tm)ve engaged in many hours of discussion with both students and seasoned professionals about the merits and short-comings of this book.Â Iâ€(tm)ve also recommended this book to both friends and family.  
First, the criticism.Â This is a love it or hate it book.Â I loved it, my wife hated it.Â Some in our discussion group loved it, others hated it.Â You might love it, you might hate it so sorry, I canâ€(tm)t offer you more on that.Â Of those who hated hereâ€(tm)s what they didnâ€(tm)t like:Â 1\.
