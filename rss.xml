            <title><![CDATA[New Media Brand Loyalty]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>New Media Brand Loyalty</h1><p>RecentlyEuro RSCG Worldwidereleased an article inPRWeekwhich found that last year there was a 25% increase in the number of consumers who buy based on quality over price despite nearly 75% being anxious about the economy. Further, when it comes to customer service, 80% of those surveyed said they want companies to "show a human face." Marketing 2.0 implements new media technologies that enable you to offer higher quality and personalized service to your customers. It's what they want, shouldn't you give it to them?Marketing 101: A negative customer experience results in higher attrition while a positive experience results in repeat customers and recommendations. Compounding this point: attrition rates are multiplied by the increased cost of attracting new customers while customer retention is both less expensive and worth more over the lifetime of the relationship.So how do we retain customers? Give them what they want, when they want, how they want it.What do they want?They want what you have to offer. How do I know? Because if they don't want what you have to offer, you shouldn't be marketing it to them. The days of build it and they will buy it are over. Today's economy is based onThe Long Tail, and the tail is getting longer. Consumers have preference, and they act on it. AsSeth Godinobserves in his bookMeatball Sundae, the new bell curve isn't a bell curve at all; it's more like a camel's back. The first hump represents those who want quality, the second hump represents those who want cheap. The chasm in the middle is the lack of sales to all those companies who tried to do both and ended up doing neither.The customers you want are on the first hump of the camel curve. These people have loyalty. They know what they want. They find something they like, something of value to them, and they form a relationship with it. They form a relationship, then they recommend it to others. Hump two, on the other hand, is fickle and price conscious with very little brand loyalty. Market to them if you like, but don't forget: you can't make up for negative margins with volume!When do they want it?When they're good and ready, that's when. They have an email account for their convenience, not yours. They have a phone and a mailing address for their use, not yours. There are over 172 million people subscribed to the national do not call list because they don't want to hear from you. These people took the time to go to a website and register with the government. They put effort into not hearing from you. So why do you market to them? Instead you should be concentrating on those that do want to hear from you. Your current customers and those that give you express permission to have a conversation ( a.k.a. permission marketing). A two-way communication where you are interested in them and they are interested in you. When you cease to have value, the conversation will end. Continue to have value, continue to be relevant, and continue to have loyal customers.How do they want it?That's for them to decide. It's your job to keep their opportunities open. That's New Marketing Media. That's Marketing 2.0.</p></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Marketing 2.0: Good Marketing to Great Marketing]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Marketing 2.0: Good Marketing to Great Marketing</h1><p>There are a lot of good marketers out there. They are good because they consistently deliver good ROI by building good campaigns that deliver good results. Marketing 2.0 isn't about being good. It's about being great. Good, as defined byJim Collins, is the enemy of great, which is why there are a lot of good marketers and many fewer great ones. Collins's bookGood to Greatdescribes many concepts in management that relate directly to Marketing 2.0. Here's just a few to whet your appetite. You'll have to read his book for the rest :-)The Hedgehog Concept: A core idea that: drives your economic engine, you can be the best in the world at, and you are deeply passionate about. If you cannot honestly say you meet all three of these criteria, how can you expect your customers to choose you over your competitor who can? Marketing 2.0 is about bringing value to your customers by embracing the democratization of value, i.e. customers decide what is value (benefit / price) and migrate toward where the most value is. We see this over and over again with concepts like the long tail and the wisdom of crowds.Confront the brutal facts. Listen to your customers, listen to the market, and evaluate your results. Confronting the brutal facts is not giving in, it's being realistic about what you have to offer your customers. Be open to kudos, be open to criticism, and be open to change. This becomes an extremely important concept when you ask yourself what you are really offering your customers and how much you are asking from them.The Flywheel, where a small but consistent effort builds the momentum of your overall concept. Through new media marketing, a small be dedicated group is worth much more over a lifetime than a much larger motley group. New media and social networking is about working in conjunction with your customers to push that flywheel just a little faster. Momentum builds the force of your brand eventually leading it to take on a life of it's own. Malcolm Gladwell's bookThe Tipping Pointis full of examples of this.Technology as an accelerator, not a creator, of momentum. Given the potential for technology use that new media allows, this chapter is especially applicable. Seth Godin, in his bookMeatball Sundae, talks about syncing up your marketing to your business. Remember the old adage, "when all you have is a hammer everything looks like a nail"? Marketing 2.0 takes the opposite approach. Marketing 2.0 has a full tool box. It draws upon all marketing media to decide what is the best way to communicate with your customers as individuals. It is not about putting up a website. It's not about starting a blog. It's not about opening a twitter or facebook account. Any one of these things can be great if they align right with your industry, your business, and your customer. I can guarantee, however, you'll never reach my grandparents with any of them.</p></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[The Value of New Media Marketing]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Value of New Media Marketing</h1><p>The initial appeal of online marketing was in thelong tail. With the marginal cost of the next 100,000 being extremely low, why wouldn't you? New media marketing is different. New media isn't about cost; it's about value. AsSeth Godinobserves, there are two ways for you to benefit from marketing: lower cost, or increase value. New media marketing is the latter.First, note that this is based on the concept:value = benefit / priceWhen we talk about value, we are talking about two things: value to you as a marketer, and value to your customers. Traditional mass marketing increases value to you by lowering direct cost but forfeits personalization thereby decreasing benefit, and proportionally value, to potential customers. This worked in the short term, but the sun is setting on that day. Spam filters are getting better (yes, non-permission based marketing is still considered spam by customers even if you do comply with all the can spam rules), and customers are getting smarter.New media is different. New media increases your value by increasing value to the customer. It'swin-win! New media is about cultivating a relationship with your customers, not managing it. It's about them wanting to hear more from you because you offer them value. New media is not lower your price value, it's increase your benefit value. Increasing the benefit to your customers while keeping the costs fixed raises your value which improves response rates significantly which, as a result, increases the benefit to you.The result: fewer customers are worth more. Much more. Check out my blog posts, "The New Media Marketing Matrix" and "New Media Retention Marketing", for more on that.</p></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[New Media Marketing Matrix]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>New Media Marketing Matrix</h1><p>Today's fast pace consumer environment requires that people get what they want, when they want, and how they want it. That's where New Media marketing comes in. Traditionally you could opt to send a direct piece, an email, or place a quick phone call. New Media Marketing says what's with this "or" business? Everyone is an individual and needs to be treated as such.You don't treat one friend exactly the same as another, do you? Neither should you with your customers. New Media and Marketing 2.0 is about forming and cultivating relationships, just like you do with your friends. One of my friends is on Google Talk all day, I always know how to get in touch with him. Another is always on Facebook, while another won't be found near his computer on a sunny day. If I wanted to contact all my friends right now there's no single way to do it, but there is a best way for each of them.This is Marketing 2.0.</p></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[New Media Retention Marketing]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>New Media Retention Marketing</h1><p>In today's recession-based economy organizations are making a drastic change away from mass (acquisition) marketing toward retention marketing.Â On the consumer side, potential prospects are reeling in their spending and sliding downthe long tailby finding exactly what they want, when they want it, and for the price they want to pay.Â With acquisition marketing getting more expensive and less effective (see Zain Raj's piece on markeing focus), retention is where businesses are headed, and New Media is the tool.Some agencies simply dismiss New Media or worse, think of it as just another piece of CRM.Â They couldn't be more wrong.Â CRM is all about "managing" the relationship, and I just told you consumers don't want to be managed anymore.Â New Media is is about cultivating the relationship, not exploiting it.Â Give the consumer a reason to follow you on Twitter, join your Facebook friend list, or subscribe to your blog and that relationship will be be worth more over a lifetime than 100 new acquisitions.Â One client I have gets over a 75% click through rate on their newsletters because consumerswantto know more about what they have to offer.Why?Â New Media Marketing is designed around the concept of giving the customer what they want.Â It's about opt-in marketing.Â No, not the kind of opt-in marketing where you default the check-box at the bottom of your form.Â I'm talking about true opt-in marketing -- permission marketing.Â First, customers find you, possibly through a friend or colleague who recommended you (maybe posted your link on Facebook or twitter).Â Next, they research you.Â They check your history (the Internet never forgets), see what you've done, and see if they like it.Â And, finally, they make their own decision as to whether or not you're worth their precious and fleeting time.Â Â If you're lucky enough and you've got enough to offer you've made a friend.Now it's time to cultivate (not manage) the relationship.Â One colleague of mine follows over 150 people on Twitter and has real-time text notification of Facebook status updates sent to his iPhone via SMS.Â If you try to manage your relationship with someone like him for your own benefit you can bet he won't hesitate to not only cut you off, but also spread the word to the 150 people that are following him.Â Remember, you exist to provide value to the consumer, not the other way around.Â If you can do this profitably, then you have their permission to cultivate the relationship.The bottom line.Â Provide value, retain customers.</p></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Brand marketing vs. personal sales]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Brand marketing vs. personal sales</h1><p>Many brands would love to utilize the power of New Media, but shifting away from traditional media methodologies is not easy, especially for the older and larger agencies. Currently personal sales seems to be a much better fit for new media which raises the question, "how do we make brand marketing personal?"There's one business model in particular that I think fits the New Media mold perfectly. There's an irony here because the industries that use it seem to have positioned themselves as the late majority, or dare I say laggards, along theproduct diffusion curveof New Media technology. The model I'm talking about is that of insurance, real estate, accounting, and even pharmaceutical.Here's how it works: a parent company owns and cultivates the brand. Smaller organizations, either through licensing or branching, work independently to sell that brand. Within the child organization individuals work, mostly on commission, to build relationships and sell products offered by that brand. It's the perfect storm of New Media! Personal sales with a regional organization for product support and a parent company for brand support. Think about it. When you want an insurance agent, real estate agent, or doctor, accountant what's the first thing you do? Ask a few trusted friends for a recommendation.What if that trusted friend followed an accountant on twitter because she gives regular tips on how to save money and invest wisely? What if an insurance agent has a blog where he doles out creative ways to use insurance to better your financial situation enabling you to retire sooner and wealthier? How about a real estate agent that posts youTube videos on things to look for when evaluating a potential new home purchase and ways to inexpensively improve the value of your current home? What if these personalized sales agents market to people by providing everyday value, not just when they want something?The result: personalized service that provides value to the customer, referrals to the agent, sales to the agency, and strengthens the brand. Which, of course, leads to more referrals to the agent, sales to the agency....This is critical mass marketing. This is Marketing 2.0.</p></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[The Flip Side of New Media]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Flip Side of New Media</h1><p>In discussing new media marketing most of the questions I get widdle down to "how do I get my message out?" This is a very Marketing 1.0 perspective on Marketing 2.0. We're not going to talk about that. What we are going to discuss is all the other, non-billboard-like, uses of new media.The first thing to note is that simply creating a blog, twitter, youTube, or facebook account does not mean you are instantly utilizing the power of marketing 2.0. It takes a lot more than that. One of the highest hurdles for traditional marketing folk to pass is making the mental transition from one-to-many (mass) marketing, past one-to-one (customized) marketing, to many-to-many (social) marketing.Many of us get caught-up at that second phase, one-to-one, or even one-to-many, because we have a hard time releasing control of our message. We are convinced we know what the consumer wants. In his best selling book,The Tipping Point, Malcolm Gladwell describes many ideas that take on a life of their own. He calls this the tipping point, boiling point, or reaching critical mass. This book was a NYT best seller, so millions of you bought it, read it, and said, "wouldn't that be great". Yet, for some reason, you still refuse to relinquish control to the social.New media is social media. Pretend, for a moment, you attend a social event every day. At that party is a very interesting person but they only ever talk, never listen. At first you may find them intriguing, so you stick around and listen. The second week is a bit more frustrating so you begin to branch out (after all, this is a social event). By the second month you're warning newcomers to steer clear of that arrogant windbag. Listen, and there is a lot you can learn.Listen to the people. Croudsourcingis shorthand for the trend of leveraging the mass collaboration enabled byWeb 2.0technologies to achieve business goals or, more succinctly, distributed problem-solving and production model. By now everyone has heard the Henry Ford quote, "if I had asked the people what they wanted, they would have said a faster horse", but Ford, of course, did not have access to products likeIBM's Jam softwarewhich facilitated Innovation Jam 2006, the worlds largest online brainstorming (croudsourcing) session. Since then they've used the application to help impact issues of urban sustainability, hunger, environmental concerns, health, and quality of life. IBM listened to the people. Then they invested $100 million in 10 new projects that resulted.Google did something similar withProject 10^100(pronounced "Project 10 to the 100th") by calling for ideas from around the globe which change the world by helping as many people as possible. The neat part about this, I thought, is that you only need the idea, not the skill to implement nor the knowledge to make it work. Just the idea. To make it all happen Google set aside $10 million to finance the winning idea. The winner, by the way, will be picked by you. With over 150,000 submissions, Google is going to change the world by listening.Listen to the clients. If you're in business, then you've got clients. The CEO of my company (Zain Raj, Euro RSCG Discovery), for example, has ablog. If you think you might want to do business with us and want to know what he's thinking, there it is. Likewise, if we want to win business, the CEO of a potential client might also have a blog. Read it. The company may have a newsletter. Sign up for it. Take an active and real (they'll know if it's not) interest in your clients and what they want. Cultivate the relationship. Then, and only then, ask what you can do to help.New media is social media. Listen, or risk being ignored.</p></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[The Best Day to Send an Email]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Best Day to Send an Email</h1><p>Browsing the message boards the other day I saw someone posted the question: "what's the best day to send an email campaign?". Immediately, the fundamental flaw with this question jumped out at me, i.e. it does not take into account the individuality of the customers you are marketing to. In fact, such a broad question doesn't even take into account the preferences of the segment or, for all I know, the preferences of any single country. Marketing 2.0 is about knowing your customers and cultivating relationships. It's about catering to their needs as individuals, not as segments, and certainly not as "the best day to send an email".Several people replied to the question with valid statistics on opens (Friday), click-throughs (Sunday -- but with poor opens), and overall performance (mid-week). Based on the variety of these replies I imagine the poster is no better off now than before. Basically the answers didn't say anything. This is because the best day to contact your customers is the best day for your customers asindividuals. New media marketing is about cultivating the relationship with each of your customers. Given this, why stop at the best day to send an email? What about the best time? How about breaking away from emails and utilizing the best method of contact?As an individual, I have a schedule and so do you. If, for instance, I wanted to get in touch with you right now the best way might be to post to this blog since that is was you are reading. You could, however, be reading this on either a mobile device or a computer. You may be at work, you may be at home, you may be on a train between the two, or you could be someplace completely different. You may have twitter pinging you with an SMS, or you may follow my RSS. You could have found a link on a message board, or you may have linked to this blog in an email from a friend, or maybe this post is syndicated. An hour from now the best way to contact you may be completely different than it is right now. Today may be the best day for you to receive an email, but is an email really the best way to contact you today? Right now?The point is think about how you got here. Now think about all the ways that everyone else may have gotten here. Now ask yourself, is there really abestway to get here or only different ways? Some of the more literal types might say "yes, there is a 'best' way", so I ask you, how good is it really? This isThe Long Tailof communicating with your customers where the sum total return of the best way is no where close to the sum total return of all the other ways. As a marketer, why would you give all that up in pursuit of "the best day"?This is a new age of marketing where we are not restricted to "the best day". This is Marketing 2.0 where we think in terms of the best hour of the best day using the best method to cultivate the relationship with you as an individual.</p></article>]]></description>
