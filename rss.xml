            <title><![CDATA[Book Review: Good to Great]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Book Review: Good to Great</h1><p>Jim Collins. (2001).Good to Great. HarperBusiness  Jim Collins and his team did a great job of breaking down both business and leaders into factors that helped make them successful.Â Though Collins markets it as a business book I believe, like those of Covey, the theories in this book will serve you well in both business and personal aspects of your life.Â This book was used as a text in my MBA studies at Fairleigh Dickinson Universityâ€™s Silberman College of Buisness, a nationally top ranking entrepreneurship school.Â As such Iâ€™ve engaged in many hours of discussion with both students and seasoned professionals about the merits and short-comings of this book.  First, Iâ€™ll start with where it comes up short since everyone loves that and Iâ€™d prefer to finish on a positive note anyway.Â Some people feel that Collinsâ€™s findings just arenâ€™t possible to implement in real world work environments.Â Others argue that most of this material just doesnâ€™t apply to anyone thatâ€™s not a senior executive in the organization.Â Last, and my favorite, is the rational that success, especially in these companies, is random and luck based.Â I contend theyâ€™re all wrong, and Iâ€™ll tell you why.Â The only criticism of this book I do accept is Collinsâ€™s criteria for a successful company is purely financial, which I donâ€™t agree with, but he does address his reasoning right at the beginning.Â I understand why he had to do it, but I still donâ€™t agree with it.  To those who argue Collinsâ€™ methods are not implementable in the real world I say quit arguing the metaphors and learn from the principles.Â Try not to get stuck duplicating the examples Collins uses in the book, they are just examples.Â Read between the lines and just pull out what heâ€™s trying to sayâ€¦ â€œfirst whoâ€¦â€, â€œThe Hedgehog Conceptâ€, â€œThe Flywheelâ€, and, if you have the audiobook, pay close attention to the student question in the epilogue.Â These are simple concepts that can have a great impact on you, your organization, and your career.Â I contend that each and every one of the theories in this book can be implemented in business at all levels, not just at the top, as well as everyday life.Â I believe you can be a level five leader in life, not just in business.Â The bookLeadership and Self-Deception, by The Arbinger Institute, is a great book to emphasize this point.  And, finally, for anyone that feels success is random and/or we canâ€™t break it down into a set of rules or principles Iâ€™d recommend reading Talebâ€™sThe Black Swan, (a great book btw) which might make you feel better about yourself.Â Iâ€™d also recommendOutliersby Gladwell, another book which does in-depth research into success.Â Look specifically at the 10,000 hour rule and see how well it fits with Collinsâ€™s Flywheel concept.  Now for the pros of this book.Â There are too many to list.Â Collinsâ€™s principles of level five leadership, the fly wheel, the doom loop, build-up to break-through, etc., etc., and so on, and so on are all very good points.Â Again, these principles donâ€™t just apply to business, they apply to life.Â Iâ€™m currently a technology marketing professional, but not a sr. executive.Â Build-up to break-through and the flywheel concept are just two great ways Iâ€™ve made a difference in my organization from the bottom up.Â Iâ€™m also an entrepreneur and own my own business and one of the best things I found about Good To Great was The Hedgehog concept and how it applies to Gladwellâ€™s 10,000 hour rule.  Overall a good read with great theories.Â As always the metaphors and examples can be argued until youâ€™re blue in the face, but if you attempt to do that then youâ€™ve already missed whatâ€™s important about this book.</p></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Book Review: Leadership and Self Deception]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Book Review: Leadership and Self Deception</h1><p>The Arbinger Institute. (2000).Leadership and Self-Deception: Getting Out of the Box. San Francisco: Berrett-Hoehler.The Arbinger Institute did a great job of explaining their theory as will serve you well in both business and personal aspects of your life.Â It was a very easy read and has a lot of potential to make you think about yourself and how you relate to both the world and your job.Â This book was used as a text in my MBA studies at Fairleigh Dickinson Universityâ€™s Silberman College of Buisness, a nationally top ranking entrepreneurship school.Â As such Iâ€™ve engaged in many hours of discussion with both students and seasoned professionals about the merits and short-comings of this book.Â Iâ€™ve also recommended this book to both friends and family.First, the criticism.Â This is a love it or hate it book.Â I loved it, my wife hated it.Â Some in our discussion group loved it, others hated it.Â You might love it, you might hate it so sorry, I canâ€™t offer you more on that.Â Of those who hated hereâ€™s what they didnâ€™t like:Â 1. It was not well researched.Â Itâ€™s just a story with no data or anything hard to back it up.Â 2. The story is an obvious fabrication used to make a point, which it is, but I can get past that and listen to the point.Â 3. This book is written like a teacher speaks to third graders.Â 4.Â Itâ€™s just not realistic.Â Itâ€™s a recipe to be stepped on and taken advantage of.Â For this to work the entire organization would have to buy in.Â 5. The end of the book is an obvious marketing ploy to bring business into the Arbinger Institute.Now, the rebuts and the positives.Â 1 & 2. Forget the story.Â The story is a medium for the lesson, and the lesson is a good one.Â The research did not go into the story, the research went into the lesson.Â 3.Â I agree that the book seems like itâ€™s written by a third grade teacher, but I appreciate it.Â At first I did not but then I realized that I was actually retaining the information.Â Itâ€™s very useful if you are going to be putting the book down and picking it up again later.Â If not, itâ€™s just a quick read.Â 4.Â The whole lesson is greater than the sum of its parts.Â This is one of those books youâ€™ll have to read four or five times, have a friend read it, discuss it a bit, and then have a dream about it before you get that a-ha moment.Â You'll fight the concepts at first, everyone seems to, but when it comes itâ€™s worth it and all things fall into place.Â 5.Â As for the blatant marketing, skip the last chapter (24), youâ€™ll feel better about the book.I like this book and plan on reading it at least once per year.Â Itâ€™s a quick read that will help center you in life and in leadership.Â It goes very well with the concept of Level 5 Leadership from Collinsâ€™s bookGood to Greatand Coveyâ€™s7 Habits.</p></article>]]></description>
