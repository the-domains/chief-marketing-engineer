Not so bad. But what happens when this goes horribly wrong? Suddenly it becomes blatantly obvious that you really don't know your customers very well. And that's a scary thing.<br><strong>1. Do not inconvenience your customers to add value</strong>.<br>A friend of mine, like a lot of people these days, is looking for a job. She's been working on her resume for some time, has consulted a professional career counselor and utilized the resume critiquing services of a prestigious pay-to-play job placement website. While in her job search she found an opportunity on a job board which caters to the alumni of her alma mater and wished to apply. Within reason, to create an account on the website and apply for the job her account needed to be approved by the university and she needed to upload a resume. No problem. But then the twist. Her resume was denied. It had taken over a week for them to get back to her, a week she had spent not applying to a potential job opportunity, and now she was denied. She had worked hard, payed good money for professionals, and her resume was denied. As it turned out, the university has it's own set of career counselors who, as a service to her, review and critique resumes. But, rather than offer this as a value added service, they impeded her job search and frustrated her. Where's the value in that?<br><strong>2. Understand the value your customers are seeking before adding to it</strong>.<br>There are lots of ways organizations can add value, but without understanding customers it's really just a shot in the dark. This is where customer relationship cultivation and behavior first marketing comes into play. Cultivating relationships with your customers helps you understand what is important to them and the real value your organization is providing. It might not be as straight forward or obvious as you think. To do such a thing requires commitment on both sides of the fence. The organization needs to support the marketing, and the marketing needs to support the customer. Circuit City, for instance, tried to become Best Buy but they had neither the infrastructure nor the customer base. As a result they increased the size of their stores, lowered service, their true value to the customer, and still couldn't match Best Buy's prices profitably. The end result: no more Circuit City.<br>If Circuit City truly understood why certain customers stuck with them instead of going down the street to Best Buy or simply shopping on Amazon and how customers used the sales staff to purchase they might have survived. Price, as it turned out, was not the primary value they were providing to their customers. It was the knowledgeable staff and service which kept people coming back, two things they removed in an effort to add value.<br><strong>3. Value is not a zero-sum game.</strong><br>I recently heard a story about poor use of information with a good intention. An organization I know of nearly crashed their company in an effort to add value to it's most profitable customers. Their idea was to identify the customers responsible for the most revenue and treat them like royalty in an effort to gain new business. Grow deeper not wider. Sounds reasonable, right? Their mistake: forgetting about<a title="The Long Tail" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_long_tail">The Long Tail</a>. The plan: add value to one set of customers and remove value from a very large set of smaller customers. The reason: there are only so many sales people and the day isn't getting any longer. As individuals, members of this segment do not contribute very much but, as a group, they make up a significant percentage of the bottom line. This was known and understood, but an incorrect assumption was made. Management assumed that, because a customer makes a relatively small purchase, the purchase is less important to said customer than one who makes a larger purchase. Taken as fact they could make the associative leap that smaller customers require less attention. For some reason they thought smaller customers wouldn't mind being informed that their business is, in fact, relatively small and thus less important than someone else. The customers got the message loud and clear and took their business elsewhere.<br>In this case the organization did not understand the elasticity of their product and the value the sales representative, not the product itself, was providing. As a result the organization did not add resources to the initiative and value became a zero sum game. Some customers won, and some customers lost. As it turned out the most profitable customers are not automatically the most valuable and revenue was severely impacted.<br><strong>4. Take the step.</strong><br>Many of these individuals are already our customers. We already have the data. Knowing our customers, their behavior, and the real value we provide is just one step away and will help us make informed decisions. Take the step.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-v_Column-77e11c4f-f6d0-4721-98ee-f14b9551161f" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title title-size-medium p-0 ms-p-3 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-left  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="24"><div class="Component fx-c a-i-center p-1 " data-reactid="25"><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 max-w-768px m-a" data-reactid="26"><!-- react-empty: 27 --><!-- react-empty: 28 --><div class="System-font  Headline" data-reactid="29"><h1 data-reactid="30"><span class=" color-box-pop" data-reactid="31"><a class="font-title " href="marginal-non-negative-impact" data-reactid="32">Marginal Non-Negative Impact</a></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 33 --><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="34"><p>You send emails every day. You send an email to a friend or colleague, and it goes through. Occasionally you check the spam folder to see if anything important was missed. Usually it wasn't. Spam filters have gotten pretty good in that way. But, in this case, the spam filter is on your side. As marketers, even legitimate ones, this is not the case. Many people do not realize the real impact of spam filtering on legit marketing campaigns. Here are just a few things that happen:<br>Email has fallen into a "more the merrier" routine. The variable cost of adding individuals to lists is nearly zero, so the party grows. If they don't want to get the email, they'll opt-out, right. No problem. But there is. Technically, for something like email, a negative action like this impacts the validity of the sender which has a negative impact on future deliverability of campaigns. ISPs maintain "white lists", much like the permanent record your teachers always threatened you with, of email senders. It contains both a history and a rating. Unlike the fictitious permanent record, however, the Internet truly never forgets. Lower your rating and lower your deliverability, the rate at which you are allowed to send emails, and a few other important factors which catapult you into the downward spiral of being denied by the ISP.<br>If email blast lists were sorted by which prospects really should see the emails followed by who the marketers added just to get the numbers up then it wouldn't be as much of a problem but, unfortunately, they are not. Who does and does not actually get to see the email is randomized by the ISP. Send too many emails? They cut you off. Send emails too fast? they cut you off. Have too many complaints? They cut you off. Where did they cut you off? Who got the email? Who did not? It's not up to you, the worst case being everyone it was intended for were cut off. When it comes to a large ISP like yahoo or gmail, for instance, something like this can have quite an impact on the success of the campaign. This is especially true if timing is of the essence as in a holiday promotion or limited time/quantity campaign.<br>The interesting thing is that customers do actually reward marketers for quality but we, as humans, have an innate problem with processing small numbers and aggregating the total impact in our heads. It's easy to do when we think about cost, like the variable costs of emails approaching zero, but when we think about a benefit of near zero doesn't seem to be worth much. As we consider the low marginal cost of a single email we also consider a single opt-out or spam complaint very low impact but, like on the outbound side of the campaign, the variable cost of inbound feedback adds up such that the aggregate does, in fact, make a difference. This value of this is not in positive feedback as we would assume, but lack of negative feedback, which is also important and regularly overlooked. A targeted campaign can be just as successful in aggregate and more highly successful in percentages, cost [marginally] less, and result in future campaigns being more successful.<br>There are two extremes to marketing methodologies and the confusion between them is a symptom of not choosing a strategy that matches your organization and sticking with it. Some organizations have a high customer churn rate while others seek repeat customers and lifetime value. As such, observing one product successfully marketing one way may not work for you, even in the same industry, simply because your organization is not setup to support the style of marketing. Circuit City coming from a service model and trying to be Best Buy is a great example of the failure that can occur. This is the basis for behavior first marketing and customer relationship cultivation. It's about knowing your products, how your customers use them, and how you can better provide value as they observe it.<br>Do this and they may reward you with a marginal non-negative impact... which is a good thing.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-h_HeadingTextual2col-93e6bb67-cd83-464f-8cf6-88a85d00181a" class="Section Section--components-1 title-size-large color-title text-align-center d-b p-0 ms-p-3 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-left  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="35"><div class="Component p-1 " data-reactid="36"><div class="Group Group--heading p-1 m-a" data-reactid="37"><div class="System-font m-a Headline" data-reactid="38"><h1 data-reactid="39"><span class=" color-box-pop" data-reactid="40"><a class="font-title " href="i-want-to-be-an-intern" data-reactid="41">I Want To Be An Intern</a></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 42 --></div><!-- react-empty: 43 --><div class="Group Group--textual p-1 ms-t-a-j col-2 col-gap-s m-a" data-reactid="44"><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="45"><p>I want to be an intern.  Sounds crazy, right?  Interns get all bunk jobs others don't want, right?  They got the radio jobs when radio was the new media no one believed in.  They got the TV jobs when television was the new media that would be dead in a few years.  You know, the bunk jobs with the short-lived, newfangled, new media which would never replace what came before it.  Well, I'm an Internet Marketing 2.0 professional, and I want to be an intern.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="46"><p>I love to read business, marketing, and economics books.

react-empty: 68 --></div><div class="Group Group--textual p-1 fx-1" data-reactid="69"><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="70"><p>What is the value of an ad not seen?Â Worse yet, what is the value of an ad seen but not acted upon?Â For years we as marketers have worked hard to turn the Internet into a place where ads are proactively blocked, filtered, and ignored.Â Agencies are paid to increase list size, not list quality.Â Rather than put time into properly segmenting our prospects and compiling an offering that is relevant, we collect information in any way possible and blast emails to everyone.Â This is because we choose quantity over quality thinking we're getting the best bang for our buck.Â We're not.<br><strong>The economics of increasing list size.</strong><br>Agencies are paid to increase the size of lists, increase club memberships, and collect prospect information in any way possible.Â They do this in all sorts of "creative" ways from refusing to filter out known dead leads (can't decrease the list size) to collecting information on prospects that have no interest in the productÂ Just the other day I was at the<a title="Sussex County Farm & Horse Show" href="http://www.njstatefair.org/">NJ State Fair</a>and I was approached to sign up to win a smart car.Â All I had to do to enter was give them all my contact information.Â But what did they think they were going to do with this information once they had it?Â Beyond showing the increasing aggregate list counts to clients, I don't think they cared.Â The scary part is some client out there might actually think the contest was a success.<br>Lets take a second to analyze this.Â It's possible that the agency in charge of the smart car contest made the connection that if I wanted a smart car for free, I might have an interest in buying one?Â Maybe?Â Could that be the leap in logic?Â The other option is that they are just going to sell my information to a random client, which is worse, so let's go with option one for now.Â If instead of a car they were it was a pile of money, say $16k (the value of the smart car), and they offered it to me for free, would I take it?Â Sure.Â Would I pay more than I thought it was worth for it?Â Umm, no.Â This is because it comes down to creating value for the consumer, which they made no effort to do.Â The fact is before I was asked if I would take the car for free I never considered purchasing one.Â And, after someone offered it to me for free, I still never considered purchasing one.Â I commute on NJ highways and I value my life, sorry.<br>However, if, for instance, the same group of people had a smart car tent with information and they did there homework, it might have been an entirely different experience.Â They could have shown me a big list of all the ways the smart car could benefit me financially.Â They could have touted the benefit to the future of the environment for my son, whom I had with me.Â They could have shown me statistics and safety ratings for the car's steel passenger cage.Â They could have done a lot of things.Â Maybe then I would have been interested.Â It is at this point, only after I had a legitimate interest in the product, they could have asked if I wanted enter the smart car contest and collected my information.Â The difference here is they've laid the foundation for a relationship first.Â Â If they were really good they could have noticed I had my young son and wife with me and noted it.Â They could have casually collected information on where I work and deduced or even asked about my commute.Â They could have found out I travel a lot.Â They could have found out what was valuable to me and catered to it when they used the information they collected to market to me later.Â And when they do, I might not ignore them.Â They could have, but they did not.<br><strong>The value of a shirt not worn -- why arbitrary list generation doesn't work.</strong><br>Those who know me know I like nice shirts.Â Nice shirts cost money.Â I've been known to pay more than others consider a reasonable amount for a single shirt, but here's why.Â I'm all about marginal utility.Â When I find something I like I ask myself, "is this better then everything else I already own?".Â In fact, price means less to me than you might think.Â Marketing to me on price alone won't work.Â If I buy one shirt at Express or Guess it might cost me between $30 - $50 (or more).Â For that, I've heard, I could buy ten shirts at Walmart.Â Here's the trick: I don't want ten Walmart shirts.Â All ten of those shirts would hang in my closet for years until I cleaned them out and donated them in like-new condition.Â In the mean time I'd probably continue wearing my old shirts.Â So now I've spent good money on ten shirts I didn't wear which would be made abundantly clear when I complain to my wife that I have nothing to wear.Â Of course it no longer makes sense for me to buy a new shirt since I have ten I don't wear.<br>See what happened there?Â The reason for not purchasing a nice shirt has become I don't wear the shirts I have.Â Given my history, it makes sense.Â It would be a waste of money for me to spend more money on a single expensive shirt because I can't afford for me not to wear it.Â It's a vicious circle of self-fulfilling prophecies.Â But what if I would wear the nice shirt?Â What then is the value of the one expensive shirt vs. the ten less expensive?Â This is the loop we've gotten ourselves into with marketing.<br><strong>Enter the Internet and mass marketing.</strong><br>CPM is the cost of touching 1000 prospects.Â It is the traditional means of normalizing ad purchases for comparison.Â C is cost, and M is the Roman numeral for 1000.Â So, by lowering the cost we lower the CPM.Â But there is another factor.Â Traditional mass marketing seeks to increase the total number of customers reached for the least amount of money.Â Since M is always 1000 in this ratio we seek out media that gives us lots of M's and a low C.Â This is where the Internet comes in.<br>Early marketers saw the Internet as a combination of an extremely low variable cost, nearly $0 (low C), and a seemingly limitless supply of potential customers (lots of M's).Â Given such a low CPM, it made sense to take traditional advertising online with banners and mass emails.Â The result was a flood of online advertisement and subsequently the CAN SPAM Act of 2003.Â CAN SPAM is an acronym for Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography And Marketing.Â We sold a lot of inexpensive shirts to a lot of people who were not going to wear them, and we called it marketing.Â You know how taxes are on par with death?Â Our marketing tactics and CAN SPAM put us at the moral level of unsolicited pornography.Â Not good.<br><strong>Customer Relationship Cultivation (CRC):</strong><br>That was yesterday.Â Today's new media rich environment is very different.Â Sure there are those who still use mass advertising to prey on individuals, but that's not new media marketing (despite the actual media used).Â Today we've collected a lot more information on our customers and we're learning how to use it right.Â We're learning to create value for them, not for us at their expense.Â We still talk about CPM, but we don't live by it.Â Even click-through rates (CPC -- cost per click) are becoming an antiquated statistic.Â Today's marketing is about behavior.Â It's about action.Â We understand that customers act first and purchase based on behavior, not the other way around.Â And we use new media to leverage this idea.Â Let me explain with two great examples from Zain Raj's<a title="Silver Lining: Using the Economic Downturn to Win Sustainable Customer

She wanted to sell some of her prints online so she came to me to help make that happen. TwoRoads is just getting started so, like any small business, money is a primary concern. Time management is also a concern since Kim would rather be out shooting and developing photos than managing the website so the website had to be easily managed and not too technical. From a technical and marketing standpoint Kim needs a website that will look and perform professionally because sales get lost when customers have to wait for images to load, and her business is all about images. The website would also need a shopping cart and have to accept credit cards because online shoppers today expect convenient shopping and payment. What an interesting case. Here's what we did:<br>The first hurdle we attacked was hosting. Since money is a concern we tried to keep monthly costs to a minimum. I thought about just putting her on my home server hosted over a cable modem but we wanted something more dependable than that. Yahoo! busness hosting came out to about $6.50 per month, which seemed reasonable. We also got unlimited data transfer, great for photos, and unlimited disk space. Yahoo! had several good options for expansion, like wordpress blog integration, so we settled on that.<br>The next hurdle to clear was how Kim would manage the site. She's not a technical person and has no desire to be. Her last website had a combination of XML files she needed to edit and files she needed to resize and upload via an ftp program. Not a horrible solution, but it was a bit confusing and very time consuming to make changes. This time we decided to use Flickr to manage the photos. Kim already had an account with Flickr. She used it to post photos and show them off. It's a great application with several convenience features including drag and drop organization and simple uploading and photo resizing. The best part: Flickr has a full access php API.<br>Flickr offered us several advantages. First, it's free. So our total costs were still only the $6.50 / month for web hosting. Second it's convenient. Kim already had an account there and was familiar with the tool. She wouldn't have to learn anything else and, at the same time, she had access to several GUI tools for the organization and manipulation of her photographs. Technically, Flickr's API gave us full access to Kim's photos and information via php. Better yet, by keeping the images on Flickr's servers we gained the hosting and response time of Flickr's diverse infrastructure because all images were served from them, not us. All we had to do was register for a free commercial development key.<br>The next thing we needed was a shopping cart and method of accepting credit cards. Yahoo! business hosting integrated directly with paypal so this was our first choice. Right away we noticed some shortcomings. First, products had to be added to paypal's inventory system for pricing, descriptions, etc. This meant Kim would have to add her products in two places and that we'd have to find a way for the website to match the Flickr photo on the screen to the product in paypay's database. Not impossible, but not the ease of management we were looking for either. Finally, what sealed the deal, is the service offered by Yahoo! did not allow for a shopping cart. Users would only be allowed to buy one product at a time. It was time to look elsewhere for a solution.<br>That's how we came upon google checkout. Google checkout offered everything we needed. A shopping cart system that integrated into our existing website. Core integration is done with JavaScript and layout is done with html and css. Fields and descriptors are completely customizable without having to first add the item to a google-specific inventory system. The shopping cart system linked directly into google's checkout system which allowed Kim to accept credit cards for just a small fee. Everything was customizable so we could seamlessly integrate it into the rest of Kim's website template. On top of all that, it was basically free with only a small charge based on her sales. This worked out well since, if nothing sold, she would have not fixed cost. In order for her to owe a lot she'd have to sell a lot, which is a good thing.<br>Another advantage of using google's checkout system was the link to her analytics account. It was not an initial feature request, but I decided to create a google analytics account for her and link it to the website and checkout system. This way we are able to see all sorts of statistics on Kim's photos and it can help her determine what's going on.<br>The final piece of the puzzle is Kim's interaction with her customers. She's a very interesting and intelligent person, so I thought she should share her stories and experiences with her customers. What better way to do that than a blog? I'd looked at both blogspot and wordpress before. Wordpress was, by far, easier to update and customize templates for. Additionally, yahoo! hosting offered a wordpress blog as a direct add on. In the end we didn't use it (opting for hosting the blog on wordpress's website), but it's still good to know we can always come back to it should we want to.<br>Here's a summary of what we ended up with:</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="96"><ul><li>Website hosting with php at Yahoo!

They contend marketers have too much information to adequately convey their message to prospective customers -- it's like an inside joke meant for the world that only we get. But what if the reverse was true? What if they are the tappers? Then we are the ones without all the information and we're missing the message the world is trying to tell us.<br>For those of you not familiar with the tappers and listeners concept, here's an overview loosely as stated in Made to Stick: In 1990, Elizabeth Newton earned a Ph.D. in psychology at Stanford by studying a simple game in which she assigned people to one of two roles: "tappers" or "listeners." Tappers received a list of twenty-five well-known songs, such as "Happy Birthday to You" and "The StarSpangled Banner." Each tapper was asked to pick a song and tap out the rhythm to a listener (by knocking on a table). The listener's job was to guess the song, based on the rhythm being tapped. Before the listeners guessed the name of the song, however, Newton asked the tappers to predict the odds that the listeners would guess correctly. The tappers predicted the odds were 50 percent. Over the course of Newton's experiment, however, listeners guessed only 2.5 percent of the songs correctly. The tappers actually got their message across 1 time in 40, but they thought they were getting their message across 1 time in 2. As marketers there are two ways we can look at this:<br><strong>Way #1 (we are the tappers):</strong><br>Tappers are us, the marketers. We have a tune in our head but cannot sing it; we can only tap it out in monotone advertisements. Listeners are our prospective customers, the targets of our marketing. They do not have the same information we have, the tune in their head, so, with only our monotone tapping to go by, they have to guess what we're trying to say. The tune in our head makes us think we've done our job, but the reality is that monotonous tapping is simply driving our customers crazy. This is what our ego would have us believe; we've got too much information for our slow customers to keep up.<br><strong>Way #2 (we are the listeners):</strong><br>It's relatively easy for companies to lay problems with marketing on the customer. It's like walking into and interview and answering the question "what's your biggest fault" with "I'm just too darn smart for all those around me. They just don't get what I'm trying to say." We all do it. We all think we're being clear. We all think what's in our head is correct and justified. And we do this until we learn otherwise, then revise our paradigm.<br>Social media is the otherwise; it's time to revise. Social media is about listening to our customers and finding out what they want. What matters to them? How can we better serve them? Within traditional marketing customers have a tune in their head and their trying to sing it but they can only tap (if that). Much of the time we're so busy tapping away trying to be louder than our competitors we can't even hear them. When/if we can, via letters and other means of feedback, there is no formal protocol to make real change. Customers only power, their only way to get their message through to us, the only thing we hear, is the sound of them leaving.<br>That was traditional marketing, this is new media. New media gives voices to each of our customers. A real voice; one that we can hear. And when these voices begin to harmonize the collective volume surpasses even our marketing. They become a voice that we should be listening to and learning from, not one that we should be blocking out with the incorrect assumption we have all the information we need. Within new media there is a conversation going on. It's already taking place and we are just a guest who is welcome, like everyone else, to participate. They don't ask much. Be relevant, be courteous, and work towards the betterment of the collective participants. Sounds a lot like a good business model.<br>New media is not a conduit for the same monotone advertising. It won't work, many have tried. In this world we are not the only tappers. No one will subscribe to the "all advertising all the time" twitter feed and, if they do, they quickly come to their senses and unsubscribe. We have to be better than that. We have to have value. And, in return for our effort, we gain insight into the collective of our customers and potential customers. We gain personal information and preferences. We gain a tune to our tapping because new media gives us the opportunity not to tune out our customers song.<br>Be a listener, not a tapper. Listen to the customers, they have a lot to say. New media users are voluntarily generating increasingly more and better data both about themselves and each other. They tell us their likes, their dislikes, their opinions and feedback, and who their friends and family are. One facebook application alone has users creating quizes about themselves to determine how well their friends know them. They are practically segmenting themselves! It's a marketers dream come true. If only we could stop tapping.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-h_HeadingTextual-8e36de25-5a11-4e58-b669-1aa2d27b5b3a" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title title-size-large p-0 ms-p-3 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-left  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="109"><div class="Component ms-fx-r p-1 " data-reactid="110"><div class="Group Group--heading p-1 fx-2" data-reactid="111"><div class="System-font  Headline" data-reactid="112"><h1 data-reactid="113"><span class=" color-box-pop" data-reactid="114"><a class="font-title " href="new-media-marketing-the-hi-tech-way-to-be-low-tech" data-reactid="115">New Media Marketing: The Hi-Tech Way to be Low-Tech</a></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 116 --><!-- react-empty: 117 --><!-- react-empty: 118 --></div><div class="Group Group--textual p-1 fx-1" data-reactid="119"><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="120"><p>The whole idea behind new media and social networking is to form deeper relationships with customers which can be cultivated into a strong bond and, hopefully, brand loyalty. We use twitter, facebook, email, linkedIn, blogs, direct mail, and several other medias to stay connected to them. We spend millions to form and cultivate the relationships but, in the process, do we forget about the relationship itself?<br>Every Saturday my town holds a farmer's market in the town hall parking lot. Local farms setup tables with fruits, vegetables, baked goods, and other wares for townies to browse and buy. Last Saturday my family and I dropped in to get a few fresh veggies for the week. While there we stopped at two farm stands, both local farms, and let the farmhands tell us what's in season and make recommendations about what we have to try. I ended up with a yellow tomato for the first time.<br>On the way out we ran into a man walking down the road with two alpacas. Of course we had to stop. A small crowd of children and adults were there petting and taking pictures with the alpacas. The farmer told everyone their names and how much they loved attention, especially when they were hugged in pictures. While we were hugging and petting he made sure that we noted how soft and friendly they were. "Wouldn't it be nice to have something this soft with you all the time? Why don't you stop in at our market stand,<a title="Angel Wood Alpacas" href="http://www.angelwoodalpacas.com/">Angel Wood Alpacas</a>, and see what we have there?"<br>Brilliant! In those few minutes we were there this man transformed us from complete strangers to falling in love with the adorable and soft alpacas. Think of the implications. From then on, anything we bought at that stand wouldn't just be an accessory, it'd be a story. It's not a scarf. It's an alpaca scarf, and I met the alpaca himself. His name is Elvis and here's a picture of me hugging him. You can meet him this Saturday at the market. Amazing! Viral marketing without a send to friend link. 100% true permission marketing. A few days later I was reading<a title="The Wealth of Nations" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Nations">The Wealth of Nations</a>and my wife asked me about it. I gave her a quick overview and she laughed but gave me some great insight to build on.<br>We are in the midst of a new revolution. One that is bringing us backward in time. We're no longer about Adam Smith's most efficient product, we're about the relationship. Curious, I asked my wife a hypothetical question: if you could buy a better or cheaper tomato somewhere else, would you? The hands down answer: no. Why? Because of the relationship.<br>In today's hi-tech, long tail, environments customers are about getting what they want, and they want a relationship. They<em>want</em>to be brand loyal becasue they want a brand they can count on. This is the age of information. Marketing is about making customers aware of your brand in such a way that they want to know more about it, and then making the information easily available.<br>New is media pull marketing, not push. It's a conversation, not a megaphone. New media is relationship cultivation, not management.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-v_Column-17227e8d-70d5-4f93-b1fc-a0eec0ea0bb3" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title title-size-medium p-0 ms-p-3 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-left  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="121"><div class="Component fx-c a-i-center p-1 " data-reactid="122"><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 max-w-768px m-a" data-reactid="123"><!-- react-empty: 124 --><!-- react-empty: 125 --><div class="System-font  Headline" data-reactid="126"><h1 data-reactid="127"><span class=" color-box-pop" data-reactid="128"><a class="font-title " href="social-media-the-leader-in-thought-leadership" data-reactid="129">Social Media: The Leader in Thought Leadership</a></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 130 --><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="131"><p>The best and brightest minds in your industry don't work for you.

They might not [insert qualification here] but, in social media, none of that matters. Gone are race, gender, pedigree, and qualification. What remains is simply the quality of your ideas and your work. Lead in thought and you are a thought leader.<br>In February of 2006, for instance,<a title="Netflix" href="http://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a>had the idea to hold a contest with a $1 million grand prize. The goal: improve on it's movie recommendation engine by 10%. Netflix supplied the data, contestants supplied the algorithms. To date there are 49552 contestants on 40738 teams from 184 different countries from which Netflix has received 41756 valid submissions. What do you think it would take to actually assemble and organize a research team that big? A lot. Which is why Netflix thinks $1 million for that kind of improvement would be a bargain. On June 27th, 2009 the winning algorithm was<a title="Winning Teams Join to Qualify for $1 Million Netflix Prize" href="http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/06/winning-teams-join-to-qualify-for-1-million-netflix-prize/">posted</a>to the Netflix leader board and the winner was not just one team. Multiple individuals formed teams and two of the leading teams organized themselves into the winning team. With no influence other than the goal and the prize these individuals took it upon themselves to organize themselves and best Netflix's professionally generated algorithm by more than 10%.<br>So what does this mean to you? A lot. The next great idea will most likely not come from within your organization, but that doesn't mean you can't be a part of it. You need to be a part of the community, the collective, and the next great idea. Remember, social media is about<a title="Why Your New Media Campaign Failed" href="/2009/06/why-your-new-media-campaign-failed/">passion</a>. Enthusiasts are enthusiasts because they love what they do. They love it, and you share their passion. You must, or you would not be in the industry. You must, or you must admit there is a better alternative to you. Someone with passion.<br>The individuals who participate in social media love it so much they want to share their love by collaborating with others who also share their passion. They enjoy the work so much that they dedicate their free time to pushing harder and further into it generating ideas that further your industry. The best answers lead to better questions, and these are the people who come up with both the problems and the solutions. These are the people you should be working with. These are the people you should be talking to. These are the people utilizing social media to connect to one another.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-h_HeadingTextual-481d24eb-0bae-4567-962a-6cba11f32d37" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title title-size-large p-0 ms-p-3 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-left  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="132"><div class="Component ms-fx-r p-1 " data-reactid="133"><div class="Group Group--heading p-1 fx-2" data-reactid="134"><div class="System-font  Headline" data-reactid="135"><h1 data-reactid="136"><span class=" color-box-pop" data-reactid="137"><a class="font-title " href="the-right-way-to-market-new-media" data-reactid="138">The Right Way to Market New Media</a></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 139 --><!-- react-empty: 140 --><!-- react-empty: 141 --></div><div class="Group Group--textual p-1 fx-1" data-reactid="142"><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="143"><p>New media marketing is about being the best.

My answer, social media.<br>The other day I had dinner with a friend of mine who showed off his brand new pair of custom<a title="Custom Converse" href="http://www.converse.com/#/products/shoes/converseOne/scratch-----31">Chucks</a>. He customized them himself at the Converse website. He chose the model, color, materials, etc.... Converse built them then shipped the shoes right to his door. Of course he paid a premium, but he got exactly what he wanted so he didn't mind. Now many of his friends are also building custom Chucks.<br>Compare that experience to my own when I tried to buy a new car. I'm well researched, so I knew what I wanted and what I wanted to pay when I walked in the door. But, unfortunately for me, cars are sold like cable TV subscriptions (via packages) so I needed two packages to get everything I wanted. It didn't take too long for me to find out that the two packages I wanted were both "regional", and what that meant. Apparently one package was primarily built and sold in the mid-west so, being on the east coast, it wasn't available. The other package was available, but not in conjunction with the first because the two regions typically didn't cross. In addition, they did not have any available to ship in any of the colors I hoped for. To get my car I needed a custom order for which I would, of course, have to pay a premium for a bunch of stuff I didn't want just to get the stuff I did. Needless to say, I didn't buy a car. In addition I told several people that story. They will not be buying a car either.<br>Imagine that. A customer comes to you, ready to buy, with cash in hand, and you lose the sale. Contrast that to several customers who knew nothing of a product but got motivated enough to buy based on the recommendation of a satisfied customer. So what does this mean to GM?<br>You can market a brand all you want but, in today's new media rich environment, you can't even fool some of the people some of the time. If GM want's to change their brand, they have to change their company to support the marketing. Transforming GM is not going to start with designing a new car, it's going to start with designing a new company. GM needs to treat the company is if it had failed, because it did, and go from there. Here's how:<br>First, admit old GM failed. Don't try to pretend it's the same company, because it's not, and nobody knows this better than the taxpayers, also known as customers. Admitting failure with accomplish two things:</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="170"><ol><li>Let the people know GM executives can recognize the obvious. A big part of branding new GM is regaining the trust of the public, especially with such a public failure. They know GM failed,<a title="Time magazine GM covers" href="http://search.time.com/results.html?N=46&Nty=1&Ntt=GM&x=23&y=8&srchCat=Covers">it's no secret</a>. This is not a "<a title="Problem Solving Workflow" href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~asb/teaching/cs101-fall05/hws/hwj3/ProblemSolving.gif">can I hide this</a>" situation. If GM doesn't admit it then customers will start to wonder what else GM's not admitting. I'm not saying GM needs a Times Square banner that says "we failed", but using terms like "New GM" or calling their vehicles "different, somehow" would go a long way. <a title="Re: Invention" href="http://www.gmreinvention.com/">Re: Invention</a>is a great start, in name, but it's been around for a while and the online videos didn't tell me anything new. Cadillac's new headlights may giving a great nighttime signature is nice, but that's no justification for the bailout. Tell me what's new. What's different. What did our tax dollars get us that we didn't have before.</li><br><li>Allow GM to start from scratch. Old GM failing paves the way for New GM to succeed. Trying to merge the two will only drag out the negative. GM needs to let their customers know this bailout was a good choice, it was not for nothing, and GM is not just going to fail again in a few months by doing the same thing.</li></ol></div></div></div></section><section id="section-h_HeadingTextual-ae283cb2-100a-4410-84b5-ea87d1e0e9ec" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title title-size-large p-0 ms-p-3 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-left  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="171"><div class="Component ms-fx-r p-1 " data-reactid="172"><div class="Group Group--heading p-1 fx-2" data-reactid="173"><div class="System-font  Headline" data-reactid="174"><h1 data-reactid="175"><span class=" color-box-pop" data-reactid="176"><a class="font-title " href="marketing-in-a-reputation-based-economy" data-reactid="177">Marketing In A Reputation Based Economy</a></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 178 --><!-- react-empty: 179 --><!-- react-empty: 180 --></div><div class="Group Group--textual p-1 fx-1" data-reactid="181"><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="182"><p><em>Cred</em>, short for<em>street credit</em>, slang for<em>your reputation</em>. Defined as: commanding a level of respect due to experience in or knowledge of issues affecting those environments. Cred is traditionally associated with young, trendy people in urban areas. Today in marketing 2.0, however, it's a unit of exchange within the emerging reputation based economy. Simple terms: more cred = more value; more value = more dedicated customers; more dedicated customers = more $$. So, how's your cred?<br>There are several different types of reputations on the Internet each impacting and being impacted by new media differently. <a title="Google" href="http://google.com/">Google</a>, for instance, bases a site's reputation on how many other sites link to it. If you want a higher ranking, get more and better sites to link to you. In the blogosphere this is called the "echo chamber" due to the effect of syndication on rankings. Ironic to the name, however, current SEO practices focus more on driving quality traffic from other sites over just any traffic from search engines. Reputation boosting practices include hosting brand sponsored topic websites where interested individuals can gather and form a community, or social network. This accomplishes two things for the brand. First, by facilitating communication the brand creates and centralizes an active community and boosts awareness of the industry. Second, by utilizing it's own networking, the brand becomes an involved member who takes an active interest in the people gaining both credibility and awareness within the community. This is especially important for emotional industries like pharma. where people can gather and share stories. The key to successfully marketing in this environment is being the best. Your job as a marketer is to facilitate relationships and communication, then let them choose you.<br><a title="Slashdot.org  -- News for Nerds.  Stuff that matters." href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a>and<a title="Experts-Exchange" href="http://www.experts-exchange.com/">experts-exchange</a>, on the other hand, establish credibility in a different, yet still automated, way. They allow users to award points to other users to establish a more natural, organic, atmosphere of credibility. Much like life, in this society if you want to gain credibility you need to earn it. Once established, credibility within these networks gain you the advantages of prestige, trustworthiness, hire ranked posts, and the increased ability to improve your reputation. A segment posted by someone with high credibility, for example, will automatically rank higher than someone with less and, therefore, will have the advantage of being spotted easier and read more often thereby granting the author more credibility in the future. Much like spinning a<a title="Jim Collins -- Flywheel" href="http://www.jimcollins.com/article_topics/articles/good-to-great.html">flywheel</a>, each positive interaction begets more positive interactions in the future. This is especially important because, unlike search engines, you cannot pay for placement; you must earn your reputation.<br>Contrasting the previous two methods,<a title="Digg.com" href="http://digg.com/">Digg</a>is based on a simple aggregate of users identifying a link as something they like, or "digging" it. Every day thousands of individuals see something they like enough to go out of their way to digg it. They do this because what they saw had some value to them. In this society, if you want to have credibility, you need to have value. Enough value to drive users to want to tell others about you. Credibility in this arena gains you a dedicated following of individuals who regularly derive value from your work. Those individuals tell others and your friend base grows.<br>Social reputation also consists of all the sites that allow users to collaboratively rate and give feedback about you. Sites like<a title="Amazon.com" href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>and<a title="Unbiased reviews by real people" href="http://www.epinions.com/">epinions</a>combine a simple 5-star rating system with a short text area to facilitate individuals expressing their level of satisfaction. Where historically business need only worry about a select few critics, now everyone's a critic. Restaurants, for example, formally sought to identify the media columnists to make sure their food was hot and the order was right. Automobile manufactures only had to impress a select few magazines and reviewers. Walmart went so far as to put commercials on television which emphasized what a great place it was to work. No more. Sell a bad product on amazon and people will know. Sure it's possible to influence this initially with staged postings, but that won't last long and isn't it easier just to deliver value?<br>The final part of your social reputation and credibility consists of everything else. This is where all the bloggers who have an experience and write about it reside and where other bloggers syndicate the post. This is where the photo of a bug in food you served falls. This is where the youTube video of your employees goofing around or slacking off fits. And this is where people can praise and recommend you. This is where people can post links to your products. This is where friends forward interesting emails. This is the culmination of your brand reputation.<br>This is new media marketing.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-v_Column-d4c24ad1-13ca-4b22-b3f2-130e152ce06c" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title title-size-medium p-0 ms-p-3 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-left  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="183"><div class="Component fx-c a-i-center p-1 " data-reactid="184"><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 max-w-768px m-a" data-reactid="185"><!-- react-empty: 186 --><!-- react-empty: 187 --><div class="System-font  Headline" data-reactid="188"><h1 data-reactid="189"><span class=" color-box-pop" data-reactid="190"><a class="font-title " href="new-media-brand-loyalty" data-reactid="191">New Media Brand Loyalty</a></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 192 --><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="193"><p>Recently<a title="Euro RSCG Worldwide" href="http://www.eurorscg.com/">Euro RSCG Worldwide</a>released an article in<a title="Solid products win out over bargain prices, study finds" href="http://www.prweekus.com/pages/Login.aspx?retUrl=/Solid-products-win-out-over-bargain-prices-study-finds/article/136711/&PageTypeId=28&ArticleId=136711&accessLevel=2">PRWeek</a>which found that last year there was a 25% increase in the number of consumers who buy based on quality over price despite nearly 75% being anxious about the economy. Further, when it comes to customer service, 80% of those surveyed said they want companies to "show a human face." Marketing 2.0 implements new media technologies that enable you to offer higher quality and personalized service to your customers. It's what they want, shouldn't you give it to them?<br>Marketing 101: A negative customer experience results in higher attrition while a positive experience results in repeat customers and recommendations. Compounding this point: attrition rates are multiplied by the increased cost of attracting new customers while customer retention is both less expensive and worth more over the lifetime of the relationship.<br>So how do we retain customers? Give them what they want, when they want, how they want it.<br><em>What do they want?</em>They want what you have to offer. How do I know? Because if they don't want what you have to offer, you shouldn't be marketing it to them. The days of build it and they will buy it are over. Today's economy is based on<a title="The Long Tail" href="http://www.thelongtail.com/">The Long Tail</a>, and the tail is getting longer. Consumers have preference, and they act on it. As<a title="Seth's Blog" href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/">Seth Godin</a>observes in his book<em>Meatball Sundae</em>, the new bell curve isn't a bell curve at all; it's more like a camel's back. The first hump represents those who want quality, the second hump represents those who want cheap. The chasm in the middle is the lack of sales to all those companies who tried to do both and ended up doing neither.<br>The customers you want are on the first hump of the camel curve. These people have loyalty. They know what they want. They find something they like, something of value to them, and they form a relationship with it. They form a relationship, then they recommend it to others. Hump two, on the other hand, is fickle and price conscious with very little brand loyalty. Market to them if you like, but don't forget: you can't make up for negative margins with volume!<br><em>When do they want it?</em>When they're good and ready, that's when. They have an email account for their convenience, not yours. They have a phone and a mailing address for their use, not yours. There are over 172 million people subscribed to the national do not call list because they don't want to hear from you. These people took the time to go to a website and register with the government. They put effort into not hearing from you. So why do you market to them? Instead you should be concentrating on those that do want to hear from you. Your current customers and those that give you express permission to have a conversation ( a.k.a. permission marketing). A two-way communication where you are interested in them and they are interested in you. When you cease to have value, the conversation will end. Continue to have value, continue to be relevant, and continue to have loyal customers.<br><em>How do they want it?</em>That's for them to decide. It's your job to keep their opportunities open. That's New Marketing Media. That's Marketing 2.0.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-LoadMoreWButton-next-page-item-0" class="Section Section--loadmore Section--components-1 color-title p-h-1 ls-p-h-2 p-v-4 color-bg  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="194"><div class="Component p-1 " data-reactid="195"><button class="color-box-pop pos-a circle w-4rem h-4rem center-hv m-0 cur-p" data-reactid="196"><span class="center-hv pos-a w-2rem h-2rem" data-reactid="197"><svg version="1.1" id="Layer_1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="384.4 271.2 26.4 26.8" enable-background="new 384.4 271.2 26.4 26.8" xml:space="preserve"><path class="color-box-pop-text" fill="#F05525" d="M397.8,298c-7.4,0-13.4-6-13.4-13.4s6-13.4,13.4-13.4c5.3,0,10.2,3.2,12.3,8l-2.8,1.2  c-1.7-3.8-5.4-6.2-9.5-6.2c-5.7,0-10.4,4.7-10.4,10.4s4.7,10.4,10.4,10.4c4.6,0,8.7-3.1,10-7.5l2.9,0.8 C409.1,294,403.8,298,397.8,298z"/><polyline class="color-box-pop-text" fill="#F05525" points="410.9,274.4 410.9,281.2 404.1,281.2 "/><rect class="color-box-pop-text" x="396.6" y="280" fill="#F05525" width="2" height="9.2"/><rect x="393" y="283.6" class="color-box-pop-text" fill="#F05525" width="9.2" height="2"/></svg></span></button></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="198"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="199"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="200"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="201"><span data-reactid="202"><!-- react-empty: 203 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="204"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="205">Chief Marketing Engineer</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="206"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="207"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="208"><div class="Link" data-reactid="209"><a data-reactid="210"></a></div></div></div></div></section></div></div>

Do not inconvenience your customers to add value.  A friend of mine, like a lot of people these days, is looking for a job. She's been working on her resume for some time, has consulted a professional career counselor and utilized the resume critiquing services of a prestigious pay-to-play job placement website. While in her job search she found an opportunity on a job board which caters to the alumni of her alma mater and wished to apply. Within reason, to create an account on the website and apply for the job her account needed to be approved by the university and she needed to upload a resume. No problem. But then the twist. Her resume was denied. It had taken over a week for them to get back to her, a week she had spent not applying to a potential job opportunity, and now she was denied. She had worked hard, payed good money for professionals, and her resume was denied. As it turned out, the university has it's own set of career counselors who, as a service to her, review and critique resumes. But, rather than offer this as a value added service, they impeded her job search and frustrated her. Where's the value in that?  2. Understand the value your customers are seeking before adding to it.  There are lots of ways organizations can add value, but without understanding customers it's really just a shot in the dark. This is where customer relationship cultivation and behavior first marketing comes into play. Cultivating relationships with your customers helps you understand what is important to them and the real value your organization is providing. It might not be as straight forward or obvious as you think. To do such a thing requires commitment on both sides of the fence. The organization needs to support the marketing, and the marketing needs to support the customer. Circuit City, for instance, tried to become Best Buy but they had neither the infrastructure nor the customer base. As a result they increased the size of their stores, lowered service, their true value to the customer, and still couldn't match Best Buy's prices profitably. The end result: no more Circuit City.  If Circuit City truly understood why certain customers stuck with them instead of going down the street to Best Buy or simply shopping on Amazon and how customers used the sales staff to purchase they might have survived. Price, as it turned out, was not the primary value they were providing to their customers. It was the knowledgeable staff and service which kept people coming back, two things they removed in an effort to add value.  3. Value is not a zero-sum game.  I recently heard a story about poor use of information with a good intention. An organization I know of nearly crashed their company in an effort to add value to it's most profitable customers. Their idea was to identify the customers responsible for the most revenue and treat them like royalty in an effort to gain new business. Grow deeper not wider. Sounds reasonable, right? Their mistake: forgetting aboutThe Long Tail. The plan: add value to one set of customers and remove value from a very large set of smaller customers. The reason: there are only so many sales people and the day isn't getting any longer. As individuals, members of this segment do not contribute very much but, as a group, they make up a significant percentage of the bottom line. This was known and understood, but an incorrect assumption was made. Management assumed that, because a customer makes a relatively small purchase, the purchase is less important to said customer than one who makes a larger purchase. Taken as fact they could make the associative leap that smaller customers require less attention. For some reason they thought smaller customers wouldn't mind being informed that their business is, in fact, relatively small and thus less important than someone else. The customers got the message loud and clear and took their business elsewhere.  In this case the organization did not understand the elasticity of their product and the value the sales representative, not the product itself, was providing. As a result the organization did not add resources to the initiative and value became a zero sum game. Some customers won, and some customers lost. As it turned out the most profitable customers are not automatically the most valuable and revenue was severely impacted.  4. Take the step.  Many of these individuals are already our customers. We already have the data. Knowing our customers, their behavior, and the real value we provide is just one step away and will help us make informed decisions.

It was the knowledgeable staff and service which kept people coming back, two things they removed in an effort to add value.<br><strong>3. Value is not a zero-sum game.</strong><br>I recently heard a story about poor use of information with a good intention. An organization I know of nearly crashed their company in an effort to add value to it's most profitable customers. Their idea was to identify the customers responsible for the most revenue and treat them like royalty in an effort to gain new business. Grow deeper not wider. Sounds reasonable, right? Their mistake: forgetting about<a title=\"The Long Tail\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_long_tail\">The Long Tail</a>. The plan: add value to one set of customers and remove value from a very large set of smaller customers. The reason: there are only so many sales people and the day isn't getting any longer. As individuals, members of this segment do not contribute very much but, as a group, they make up a significant percentage of the bottom line. This was known and understood, but an incorrect assumption was made. Management assumed that, because a customer makes a relatively small purchase, the purchase is less important to said customer than one who makes a larger purchase. Taken as fact they could make the associative leap that smaller customers require less attention. For some reason they thought smaller customers wouldn't mind being informed that their business is, in fact, relatively small and thus less important than someone else. The customers got the message loud and clear and took their business elsewhere.<br>In this case the organization did not understand the elasticity of their product and the value the sales representative, not the product itself, was providing. As a result the organization did not add resources to the initiative and value became a zero sum game. Some customers won, and some customers lost. As it turned out the most profitable customers are not automatically the most valuable and revenue was severely impacted.<br><strong>4. Take the step.</strong><br>Many of these individuals are already our customers. We already have the data. Knowing our customers, their behavior, and the real value we provide is just one step away and will help us make informed decisions. Take the step.</p>","metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"starred":true,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"_description":"","keywords":[]}}]},"77e11c4f-f6d0-4721-98ee-f14b9551161f":{"id":"77e11c4f-f6d0-4721-98ee-f14b9551161f","index":2,"created_by":"f0ca1e1b-f15b-4c09-941a-dda85153acae","updated_by":null,"created_at":"2016-05-14T02:36:58.100Z","updated_at":null,"published":true,"score":0,"path":"_posts/2016-05-14-marginal-non-negative-impact.md","_title":"Marginal Non-Negative Impact","metadata":{"@type":"Article","url":"marginal-non-negative-impact/index.html","inLanguage":null,"starred":false,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":true,"inNav":false,"_description":"You send emails every day.

The economics of increasing list size.  Agencies are paid to increase the size of lists, increase club memberships, and collect prospect information in any way possible.Â They do this in all sorts of \"creative\" ways from refusing to filter out known dead leads (can't decrease the list size) to collecting information on prospects that have no interest in the productÂ Just the other day I was at theNJ State Fairand I was approached to sign up to win a smart car.Â All I had to do to enter was give them all my contact information.Â But what did they think they were going to do with this information once they had it?Â Beyond showing the increasing aggregate list counts to clients, I don't think they cared.Â The scary part is some client out there might actually think the contest was a success.  Lets take a second to analyze this.Â It's possible that the agency in charge of the smart car contest made the connection that if I wanted a smart car for free, I might have an interest in buying one?Â Maybe?Â Could that be the leap in logic?Â The other option is that they are just going to sell my information to a random client, which is worse, so let's go with option one for now.Â If instead of a car they were it was a pile of money, say $16k (the value of the smart car), and they offered it to me for free, would I take it?Â Sure.Â Would I pay more than I thought it was worth for it?Â Umm, no.Â This is because it comes down to creating value for the consumer, which they made no effort to do.Â The fact is before I was asked if I would take the car for free I never considered purchasing one.Â And, after someone offered it to me for free, I still never considered purchasing one.Â I commute on NJ highways and I value my life, sorry.  However, if, for instance, the same group of people had a smart car tent with information and they did there homework, it might have been an entirely different experience.Â They could have shown me a big list of all the ways the smart car could benefit me financially.Â They could have touted the benefit to the future of the environment for my son, whom I had with me.Â They could have shown me statistics and safety ratings for the car's steel passenger cage.Â They could have done a lot of things.Â Maybe then I would have been interested.Â It is at this point, only after I had a legitimate interest in the product, they could have asked if I wanted enter the smart car contest and collected my information.Â The difference here is they've laid the foundation for a relationship first.Â Â If they were really good they could have noticed I had my young son and wife with me and noted it.Â They could have casually collected information on where I work and deduced or even asked about my commute.Â They could have found out I travel a lot.Â They could have found out what was valuable to me and catered to it when they used the information they collected to market to me later.Â And when they do, I might not ignore them.Â They could have, but they did not.  The value of a shirt not worn -- why arbitrary list generation doesn't work.  Those who know me know I like nice shirts.Â Nice shirts cost money.Â I've been known to pay more than others consider a reasonable amount for a single shirt, but here's why.Â I'm all about marginal utility.Â When I find something I like I ask myself, \"is this better then everything else I already own?\".Â In fact, price means less to me than you might think.Â Marketing to me on price alone won't work.Â If I buy one shirt at Express or Guess it might cost me between $30 - $50 (or more).Â For that, I've heard, I could buy ten shirts at Walmart.Â Here's the trick: I don't want ten Walmart shirts.Â All ten of those shirts would hang in my closet for years until I cleaned them out and donated them in like-new condition.Â In the mean time I'd probably continue wearing my old shirts.Â So now I've spent good money on ten shirts I didn't wear which would be made abundantly clear when I complain to my wife that I have nothing to wear.Â Of course it no longer makes sense for me to buy a new shirt since I have ten I don't wear.  See what happened there?Â The reason for not purchasing a nice shirt has become I don't wear the shirts I have.Â Given my history, it makes sense.Â It would be a waste of money for me to spend more money on a single expensive shirt because I can't afford for me not to wear it.Â It's a vicious circle of self-fulfilling prophecies.Â But what if I would wear the nice shirt?Â What then is the value of the one expensive shirt vs. the ten less expensive?Â This is the loop we've gotten ourselves into with marketing.  Enter the Internet and mass marketing.   CPM is the cost of touching 1000 prospects.Â It is the traditional means of normalizing ad purchases for comparison.Â C is cost, and M is the Roman numeral for 1000.Â So, by lowering the cost we lower the CPM.Â But there is another factor.Â Traditional mass marketing seeks to increase the total number of customers reached for the least amount of money.Â Since M is always 1000 in this ratio we seek out media that gives us lots of M's and a low C.Â This is where the Internet comes in.  Early marketers saw the Internet as a combination of an extremely low variable cost, nearly $0 (low C), and a seemingly limitless supply of potential customers (lots of M's).Â Given such a low CPM, it made sense to take traditional advertising online with banners and mass emails.Â The result was a flood of online advertisement and subsequently the CAN SPAM Act of 2003.Â CAN SPAM is an acronym for Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography And Marketing.Â We sold a lot of inexpensive shirts to a lot of people who were not going to wear them, and we called it marketing.Â You know how taxes are on par with death?Â Our marketing tactics and CAN SPAM put us at the moral level of unsolicited pornography.Â Not good.  Customer Relationship Cultivation (CRC):  That was yesterday.Â Today's new media rich environment is very different.Â Sure there are those who still use mass advertising to prey on individuals, but that's not new media marketing (despite the actual media used).Â Today we've collected a lot more information on our customers and we're learning how to use it right.Â We're learning to create value for them, not for us at their expense.Â We still talk about CPM, but we don't live by it.Â Even click-through rates (CPC -- cost per click) are becoming an antiquated statistic.Â Today's marketing is about behavior.Â It's about action.Â We understand that customers act first and purchase based on behavior, not the other way around.Â And we use new media to leverage this idea.Â Let me explain with

She wanted to sell some of her prints online so she came to me to help make that happen. TwoRoads is just getting started so, like any small business, money is a primary concern. Time management is also a concern since Kim would rather be out shooting and developing photos than managing the website so the website had to be easily managed and not too technical. From a technical and marketing standpoint Kim needs a website that will look and perform professionally because sales get lost when customers have to wait for images to load, and her business is all about images. The website would also need a shopping cart and have to accept credit cards because online shoppers today expect convenient shopping and payment. What an interesting case. Here's what we did:  The first hurdle we attacked was hosting. Since money is a concern we tried to keep monthly costs to a minimum. I thought about just putting her on my home server hosted over a cable modem but we wanted something more dependable than that. Yahoo! busness hosting came out to about $6.50 per month, which seemed reasonable. We also got unlimited data transfer, great for photos, and unlimited disk space. Yahoo! had several good options for expansion, like wordpress blog integration, so we settled on that.  The next hurdle to clear was how Kim would manage the site. She's not a technical person and has no desire to be. Her last website had a combination of XML files she needed to edit and files she needed to resize and upload via an ftp program. Not a horrible solution, but it was a bit confusing and very time consuming to make changes. This time we decided to use Flickr to manage the photos. Kim already had an account with Flickr. She used it to post photos and show them off. It's a great application with several convenience features including drag and drop organization and simple uploading and photo resizing. The best part: Flickr has a full access php API.  Flickr offered us several advantages. First, it's free. So our total costs were still only the $6.50 / month for web hosting. Second it's convenient. Kim already had an account there and was familiar with the tool. She wouldn't have to learn anything else and, at the same time, she had access to several GUI tools for the organization and manipulation of her photographs. Technically, Flickr's API gave us full access to Kim's photos and information via php. Better yet, by keeping the images on Flickr's servers we gained the hosting and response time of Flickr's diverse infrastructure because all images were served from them, not us. All we had to do was register for a free commercial development key.  The next thing we needed was a shopping cart and method of accepting credit cards. Yahoo! business hosting integrated directly with paypal so this was our first choice. Right away we noticed some shortcomings. First, products had to be added to paypal's inventory system for pricing, descriptions, etc. This meant Kim would have to add her products in two places and that we'd have to find a way for the website to match the Flickr photo on the screen to the product in paypay's database. Not impossible, but not the ease of management we were looking for either. Finally, what sealed the deal, is the service offered by Yahoo! did not allow for a shopping cart. Users would only be allowed to buy one product at a time. It was time to look elsewhere for a solution.  That's how we came upon google checkout. Google checkout offered everything we needed. A shopping cart system that integrated into our existing website. Core integration is done with JavaScript and layout is done with html and css. Fields and descriptors are completely customizable without having to first add the item to a google-specific inventory system. The shopping cart system linked directly into google's checkout system which allowed Kim to accept credit cards for just a small fee. Everything was customizable so we could seamlessly integrate it into the rest of Kim's website template. On top of all that, it was basically free with only a small charge based on her sales. This worked out well since, if nothing sold, she would have not fixed cost. In order for her to owe a lot she'd have to sell a lot, which is a good thing.  Another advantage of using google's checkout system was the link to her analytics account. It was not an initial feature request, but I decided to create a google analytics account for her and link it to the website and checkout system. This way we are able to see all sorts of statistics on Kim's photos and it can help her determine what's going on.  The final piece of the puzzle is Kim's interaction with her customers. She's a very interesting and intelligent person, so I thought she should share her stories and experiences with her customers. What better way to do that than a blog? I'd looked at both blogspot and wordpress before. Wordpress was, by far, easier to update and customize templates for. Additionally, yahoo! hosting offered a wordpress blog as a direct add on. In the end we didn't use it (opting for hosting the blog on wordpress's website), but it's still good to know we can always come back to it should we want to.

The website would also need a shopping cart and have to accept credit cards because online shoppers today expect convenient shopping and payment. What an interesting case. Here's what we did:<br>The first hurdle we attacked was hosting. Since money is a concern we tried to keep monthly costs to a minimum. I thought about just putting her on my home server hosted over a cable modem but we wanted something more dependable than that. Yahoo! busness hosting came out to about $6.50 per month, which seemed reasonable. We also got unlimited data transfer, great for photos, and unlimited disk space. Yahoo! had several good options for expansion, like wordpress blog integration, so we settled on that.<br>The next hurdle to clear was how Kim would manage the site. She's not a technical person and has no desire to be. Her last website had a combination of XML files she needed to edit and files she needed to resize and upload via an ftp program. Not a horrible solution, but it was a bit confusing and very time consuming to make changes. This time we decided to use Flickr to manage the photos. Kim already had an account with Flickr. She used it to post photos and show them off. It's a great application with several convenience features including drag and drop organization and simple uploading and photo resizing. The best part: Flickr has a full access php API.<br>Flickr offered us several advantages. First, it's free. So our total costs were still only the $6.50 / month for web hosting. Second it's convenient. Kim already had an account there and was familiar with the tool. She wouldn't have to learn anything else and, at the same time, she had access to several GUI tools for the organization and manipulation of her photographs. Technically, Flickr's API gave us full access to Kim's photos and information via php. Better yet, by keeping the images on Flickr's servers we gained the hosting and response time of Flickr's diverse infrastructure because all images were served from them, not us. All we had to do was register for a free commercial development key.<br>The next thing we needed was a shopping cart and method of accepting credit cards. Yahoo! business hosting integrated directly with paypal so this was our first choice. Right away we noticed some shortcomings. First, products had to be added to paypal's inventory system for pricing, descriptions, etc. This meant Kim would have to add her products in two places and that we'd have to find a way for the website to match the Flickr photo on the screen to the product in paypay's database. Not impossible, but not the ease of management we were looking for either. Finally, what sealed the deal, is the service offered by Yahoo! did not allow for a shopping cart. Users would only be allowed to buy one product at a time. It was time to look elsewhere for a solution.<br>That's how we came upon google checkout. Google checkout offered everything we needed. A shopping cart system that integrated into our existing website. Core integration is done with JavaScript and layout is done with html and css. Fields and descriptors are completely customizable without having to first add the item to a google-specific inventory system. The shopping cart system linked directly into google's checkout system which allowed Kim to accept credit cards for just a small fee. Everything was customizable so we could seamlessly integrate it into the rest of Kim's website template. On top of all that, it was basically free with only a small charge based on her sales. This worked out well since, if nothing sold, she would have not fixed cost. In order for her to owe a lot she'd have to sell a lot, which is a good thing.<br>Another advantage of using google's checkout system was the link to her analytics account. It was not an initial feature request, but I decided to create a google analytics account for her and link it to the website and checkout system. This way we are able to see all sorts of statistics on Kim's photos and it can help her determine what's going on.<br>The final piece of the puzzle is Kim's interaction with her customers. She's a very interesting and intelligent person, so I thought she should share her stories and experiences with her customers. What better way to do that than a blog? I'd looked at both blogspot and wordpress before. Wordpress was, by far, easier to update and customize templates for. Additionally, yahoo! hosting offered a wordpress blog as a direct add on. In the end we didn't use it (opting for hosting the blog on wordpress's website), but it's still good to know we can always come back to it should we want to.<br>Here's a summary of what we ended up with:</p>","metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"starred":true,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"_description":"","keywords":[]}},{"id":"bfba8710-453b-4fa5-806c-f15a01c69ae5","item":"15172a15-7025-47ab-9c03-513313ab1997","type":"list","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_html":"<ul><li>Website hosting with php at Yahoo!

They contend marketers have too much information to adequately convey their message to prospective customers -- it's like an inside joke meant for the world that only we get. But what if the reverse was true? What if they are the tappers? Then we are the ones without all the information and we're missing the message the world is trying to tell us.   For those of you not familiar with the tappers and listeners concept, here's an overview loosely as stated in Made to Stick: In 1990, Elizabeth Newton earned a Ph.D. in psychology at Stanford by studying a simple game in which she assigned people to one of two roles: \"tappers\" or \"listeners.\" Tappers received a list of twenty-five well-known songs, such as \"Happy Birthday to You\" and \"The StarSpangled Banner.\" Each tapper was asked to pick a song and tap out the rhythm to a listener (by knocking on a table). The listener's job was to guess the song, based on the rhythm being tapped. Before the listeners guessed the name of the song, however, Newton asked the tappers to predict the odds that the listeners would guess correctly. The tappers predicted the odds were 50 percent. Over the course of Newton's experiment, however, listeners guessed only 2.5 percent of the songs correctly. The tappers actually got their message across 1 time in 40, but they thought they were getting their message across 1 time in 2. As marketers there are two ways we can look at this:  Way #1 (we are the tappers):   Tappers are us, the marketers. We have a tune in our head but cannot sing it; we can only tap it out in monotone advertisements. Listeners are our prospective customers, the targets of our marketing. They do not have the same information we have, the tune in their head, so, with only our monotone tapping to go by, they have to guess what we're trying to say. The tune in our head makes us think we've done our job, but the reality is that monotonous tapping is simply driving our customers crazy. This is what our ego would have us believe; we've got too much information for our slow customers to keep up.  Way #2 (we are the listeners):  It's relatively easy for companies to lay problems with marketing on the customer. It's like walking into and interview and answering the question \"what's your biggest fault\" with \"I'm just too darn smart for all those around me. They just don't get what I'm trying to say.\" We all do it. We all think we're being clear. We all think what's in our head is correct and justified. And we do this until we learn otherwise, then revise our paradigm.  Social media is the otherwise; it's time to revise. Social media is about listening to our customers and finding out what they want. What matters to them? How can we better serve them? Within traditional marketing customers have a tune in their head and their trying to sing it but they can only tap (if that). Much of the time we're so busy tapping away trying to be louder than our competitors we can't even hear them. When/if we can, via letters and other means of feedback, there is no formal protocol to make real change. Customers only power, their only way to get their message through to us, the only thing we hear, is the sound of them leaving.  That was traditional marketing, this is new media. New media gives voices to each of our customers. A real voice; one that we can hear. And when these voices begin to harmonize the collective volume surpasses even our marketing. They become a voice that we should be listening to and learning from, not one that we should be blocking out with the incorrect assumption we have all the information we need. Within new media there is a conversation going on. It's already taking place and we are just a guest who is welcome, like everyone else, to participate. They don't ask much. Be relevant, be courteous, and work towards the betterment of the collective participants. Sounds a lot like a good business model.  New media is not a conduit for the same monotone advertising. It won't work, many have tried. In this world we are not the only tappers. No one will subscribe to the \"all advertising all the time\" twitter feed and, if they do, they quickly come to their senses and unsubscribe. We have to be better than that. We have to have value. And, in return for our effort, we gain insight into the collective of our customers and potential customers. We gain personal information and preferences. We gain a tune to our tapping because new media gives us the opportunity not to tune out our customers song.  Be a listener, not a tapper. Listen to the customers, they have a lot to say. New media users are voluntarily generating increasingly more and better data both about themselves and each other. They tell us their likes, their dislikes, their opinions and feedback, and who their friends and family are. One facebook application alone has users creating quizes about themselves to determine how well their friends know them. They are practically segmenting themselves! It's a marketers dream come true.

We're no longer about Adam Smith's most efficient product, we're about the relationship. Curious, I asked my wife a hypothetical question: if you could buy a better or cheaper tomato somewhere else, would you? The hands down answer: no. Why? Because of the relationship.<br>In today's hi-tech, long tail, environments customers are about getting what they want, and they want a relationship. They<em>want</em>to be brand loyal becasue they want a brand they can count on. This is the age of information. Marketing is about making customers aware of your brand in such a way that they want to know more about it, and then making the information easily available.<br>New is media pull marketing, not push. It's a conversation, not a megaphone. New media is relationship cultivation, not management.</p>","metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"starred":true,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"_description":"","keywords":[]}}]},"17227e8d-70d5-4f93-b1fc-a0eec0ea0bb3":{"id":"17227e8d-70d5-4f93-b1fc-a0eec0ea0bb3","index":10,"created_by":"f0ca1e1b-f15b-4c09-941a-dda85153acae","updated_by":null,"created_at":"2016-05-14T02:32:54.774Z","updated_at":null,"published":true,"score":0,"path":"_posts/2016-05-14-social-media-the-leader-in-thought-leadership.md","_title":"Social Media: The Leader in Thought Leadership","metadata":{"@type":"Article","url":"social-media-the-leader-in-thought-leadership/index.html","inLanguage":null,"starred":false,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":true,"inNav":false,"_description":"The best and brightest minds in your industry don't work for you.

In February of 2006, for instance,Netflixhad the idea to hold a contest with a $1 million grand prize. The goal: improve on it's movie recommendation engine by 10%. Netflix supplied the data, contestants supplied the algorithms. To date there are 49552 contestants on 40738 teams from 184 different countries from which Netflix has received 41756 valid submissions. What do you think it would take to actually assemble and organize a research team that big? A lot. Which is why Netflix thinks $1 million for that kind of improvement would be a bargain. On June 27th, 2009 the winning algorithm waspostedto the Netflix leader board and the winner was not just one team. Multiple individuals formed teams and two of the leading teams organized themselves into the winning team. With no influence other than the goal and the prize these individuals took it upon themselves to organize themselves and best Netflix's professionally generated algorithm by more than 10%.

Many of them had some great ideas. All of them danced around two core concepts: 1. Reinvent the company brand through innovation 2. Give the people what they want. The next question: how do they do it? My answer, social media.  The other day I had dinner with a friend of mine who showed off his brand new pair of customChucks. He customized them himself at the Converse website. He chose the model, color, materials, etc.... Converse built them then shipped the shoes right to his door. Of course he paid a premium, but he got exactly what he wanted so he didn't mind. Now many of his friends are also building custom Chucks.  Compare that experience to my own when I tried to buy a new car. I'm well researched, so I knew what I wanted and what I wanted to pay when I walked in the door. But, unfortunately for me, cars are sold like cable TV subscriptions (via packages) so I needed two packages to get everything I wanted. It didn't take too long for me to find out that the two packages I wanted were both \"regional\", and what that meant. Apparently one package was primarily built and sold in the mid-west so, being on the east coast, it wasn't available. The other package was available, but not in conjunction with the first because the two regions typically didn't cross. In addition, they did not have any available to ship in any of the colors I hoped for. To get my car I needed a custom order for which I would, of course, have to pay a premium for a bunch of stuff I didn't want just to get the stuff I did. Needless to say, I didn't buy a car. In addition I told several people that story. They will not be buying a car either.  Imagine that. A customer comes to you, ready to buy, with cash in hand, and you lose the sale. Contrast that to several customers who knew nothing of a product but got motivated enough to buy based on the recommendation of a satisfied customer. So what does this mean to GM?  You can market a brand all you want but, in today's new media rich environment, you can't even fool some of the people some of the time. If GM want's to change their brand, they have to change their company to support the marketing. Transforming GM is not going to start with designing a new car, it's going to start with designing a new company. GM needs to treat the company is if it had failed, because it did, and go from there. Here's how:  First, admit old GM failed. Don't try to pretend it's the same company, because it's not, and nobody knows this better than the taxpayers, also known as customers.

Apparently one package was primarily built and sold in the mid-west so, being on the east coast, it wasn't available. The other package was available, but not in conjunction with the first because the two regions typically didn't cross. In addition, they did not have any available to ship in any of the colors I hoped for. To get my car I needed a custom order for which I would, of course, have to pay a premium for a bunch of stuff I didn't want just to get the stuff I did. Needless to say, I didn't buy a car.

Many of them had some great ideas. All of them danced around two core concepts: 1. Reinvent the company brand through innovation 2. Give the people what they want. The next question: how do they do it? My answer, social media.<br>The other day I had dinner with a friend of mine who showed off his brand new pair of custom<a title=\"Custom Converse\" href=\"http://www.converse.com/#/products/shoes/converseOne/scratch-----31\">Chucks</a>. He customized them himself at the Converse website. He chose the model, color, materials, etc.... Converse built them then shipped the shoes right to his door. Of course he paid a premium, but he got exactly what he wanted so he didn't mind. Now many of his friends are also building custom Chucks.<br>Compare that experience to my own when I tried to buy a new car. I'm well researched, so I knew what I wanted and what I wanted to pay when I walked in the door.

Market to them if you like, but don't forget: you can't make up for negative margins with volume!<br><em>When do they want it?</em>When they're good and ready, that's when. They have an email account for their convenience, not yours. They have a phone and a mailing address for their use, not yours. There are over 172 million people subscribed to the national do not call list because they don't want to hear from you. These people took the time to go to a website and register with the government. They put effort into not hearing from you. So why do you market to them? Instead you should be concentrating on those that do want to hear from you. Your current customers and those that give you express permission to have a conversation ( a.k.a. permission marketing). A two-way communication where you are interested in them and they are interested in you. When you cease to have value, the conversation will end. Continue to have value, continue to be relevant, and continue to have loyal customers.<br><em>How do they want it?</em>That's for them to decide. It's your job to keep their opportunities open. That's New Marketing Media. That's Marketing 2.0.</p>","metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"starred":true,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"_description":"","keywords":[]}}]},"next-page-item-0":{"id":"next-page-item-0","index":16,"metadata":{"@type":"nextpage","starred":true},"content":[{"id":"next-page-block","type":"nextpage","_html":"","metadata":{"starred":true},"link":{"href":"index.kgy9n.html","rel":"next"}}]},"site-footer-item":{"id":"site-footer-item","index":17,"metadata":{"@type":"footer","starred":true},"content":[{"id":"site-footer-block","type":"footer","_html":"","metadata":{"starred":true},"footer":{"rss":{"href":"rss.xml","rel":"alternate","title":"Chief
