It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are\nlargely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open\ncurves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm,\nRoboto doesn’t compromise, allowing letters to be settled into their natural\nwidth. This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more commonly found in\nhumanist and serif types.","links":["https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto+Slab","https://www.typewolf.com/site-of-the-day/fonts/roboto-slab"],"normal":4,"bold":7},"screen":{"normal":4,"bold":7,"$formality":-0.09090909090909094,"$type":["sans","grotesque"],"$caps":"normal","foundry":"google","family":"Roboto","name":"Roboto","license":"apache","tags":["sans serif"],"description":"Roboto is an open-source, grotesque sans-serif typeface designed by Christian Robertson in 2011 and released through Google. Despite being accused of being a “frankenfont” mashup of DIN and Helvetica, I’m personally quite fond of Roboto. I think it renders crisply on screens and is very legible, even at smaller sizes.
